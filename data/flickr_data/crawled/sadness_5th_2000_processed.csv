Taking pictures just has not been the most important thing for me at this point, but nevertheless I will continue squeezing the shutter whenever I can.  Hopefully, we will all be able to see dramatic transformation of these areas back into their original beauty, but it is clearly a long road ahead.    If you live in the area and wish to help, please contact me and I will send you a list of volunteer centers throughout Miyagi as well as a list of important equipment to bring with you.  If you do decide to volunteer, please go with an organized group and bring the necessary equipment.  I don't mean to frighten anyone, but I was notified again today that there still are dangerous areas.  Don't go alone, please.    Here is a video that I took of the area the same day I took these pictures:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=CazswZd454o  The area that these pictures were taken, was utterly obliterated by the tsunami.  After a few hours of hauling items back and forth between my friends' destroyed home, I started to get a headache and feel sick from the fumes.  In my last post, I also mentioned that I had heard of people setting off explosions and starting fires from trying to light their cigarettes.    We worked amidst pure devastation for about 5 Hours, however we were only able to salvage a handful of their things. Sometimes it was hard to know what was theirs, since the tsunami had swept a whole city worth of belongings through the first floor of their home.  Surprisingly, the four-year-old house was in pretty good shape despite the fact that it was blown back off of its foundation about 200 feet and sat about 10-15 degrees off of level (in the video I said 60 feet, but I meant to say 60 meters.  The distance and angle is still a total guess, but you can judge for yourself in the pictures/video).  The structure of house was in such good condition, that we were able to walk up to the second floor and salvage most of the dry, smaller items.  Their daughter was just given a brand new bed and desk-set as an elementary graduation present, but we unfortunately could not take it out.     The reason we needed to go and salvage what we could as quickly as possible was because the house, although it did not look like it, was sitting in the middle of a road.  The city and self defense force had given them  only a few more days to clear out before they would have to bulldoze it down.    I asked the family if they had tsunami insurance, but apparently there is no tsunami insurance.  They will receive a small amount of money from the government, but it will not even come close to covering the damage they sustained.    The most dumbfounding part of that day for me was not surreal experience of walking through the total destruction of an entire town, but rather the laughing and smiling that came from a family who just lost everything- everything except each other.  Items and worldly possessions are of little value against the people we hold dear.  I tried to reciprocate the smiles, laughter, and healthy conversation (especially in light of the children), but it wasn't easy fighting off the grim emotions lurking below the surface.    This last weekend, I was able to volunteer for a short time in Downtown Ishinomaki and also take a few more pictures/video  The downtown area seems to be getting a lot more attention, and about half of the roads seem traversable.  Downtown also felt incredibly safe during the day time due to the dozens of police and military (both Japanese and US) walking the streets and distributing food and water at the camps.  I will post those pictures later this week.  I know my website is in shambles right now (I just have not had time), but I'm hoping to have it looking nicer as soon as possible.  I've never really sold anything from my website, but I'm going to donate all of the money I earn from ANY of the pictures I sell (not just the quake photos) to Red Cross Japan for at least the next year.  Please take it into consideration. Here is my site:  www.carstenKnoche.com  In addition, I contributed many of my pictures to QUAKEBOOK.org, and if you have never heard this organization, PLEASE check them out as well.  All of Quakebook's revenue will also go towards the Red Cross Japan.   www.quakebook.org/   Lastly, you can contribute directly to Red Cross Japan here:  www.jrc.or.jp/english/relief/l4/Vcms4_00002070.html  Thank you very much for facing this tragedy with us. With cooperation, strength, and perseverance, we can accomplish anything.  Take care, Carsten Knoche"

That was the reason to give the photos a vintage style. Of course that was my post production work, I used a DSLR. The idea was simple: Lets go back to the roots.

I kept repeating to myself, ""Christ forgives, He loves me, He knows me. He will see into my heart and know I am sorry"". It's hypocritical, and so like a sinner.   A man shoved a sign in my face, as he stood outside the clinic walls, and told me I was a murderer.  And I agree with him.  But that doesn't mean this is black and white. I never thought I would be at that place, in that seat, with my boyfriend at my side and a doctor reading off a list of side affects from taking a deadly pill.    My throat was dry and constricted with tears as the doctor instructed me on what to do. I could see it in his eyes that he knew I loved this baby, and I his empathy was etched into his face.  I am consumed entirely with grief.  And as the days went on, I told my poor baby how much I loved him. Sickening, and devastating; but real. I dreamed of holding him in my arms, of cradling him at night, of bright blue eyes and curly chestnut hair.   First steps, first words, first birthdays and Christmas's. I wanted it all.  But I couldn't give him the life it would deserve. And I was to selfish to give him away and have my heart live outside my chest, without me to protect him.  Pro-lifers ask how pro-choicers can live with themselves after it's all said and done?  Well, first...we have to figure out how to live again.  Then rest will take awhile."

Yet, like his mute guitar, the mans struggles in life are heard by few.   If only we could somehow hear the music flow, we might be surprised at the resonance the mans reminiscences of the past brings. "

My lack of motivation has contributed to this missing of content A LOT. But, there's always the next test I suppose. One bad grade isn't going to kill my whole semester. Gotta look at the glass as half full, or I'll never get past this last drag of the year.   Oh well, besides the whole stressed out to the max thing, today was alright. Pretty average as far as Green days go. I got a new notebook for psyc =) that was exciting =) (I'm a big fan of notebooks =P ). Otherwise a very uneventful day.   Hopefully tomorow will be better.

The front side of the head stone (as pictured) reads: Jesus can make a dying bed feel soft as downy pillows are, While on his breast I lean my head and breathe my life out sweetly there. Obviously this is the family of the original pastor. This just shows one of the many families who have burial plots located at the cemetery. All the headstones that you see are actually people who had families. This is where the sadness comes in. There are even a few burial plots from children who didnt make it through birth. Regardless of why, where, and when all these men and woman were buried, they all are together in one place.

According to police, Dustin W. North, 32, of Putney, was traveling toward Brattleboro in a 2005 Audi S4 when he struck head on a 2003 Volkswagen Jetta at about 11:45 a.m. on Wednesday.  North was given a roadside sobriety test while the Brattleboro Fire Department used the Jaws of Life to extricate a man from the Jetta. It took about an hour to extricate the man, who was conscious as he was wheeled on a gurney into the back of a Rescue Inc. ambulance.  North left the scene in the back seat of a police cruiser and was later cited for driving under the influence of drugs resulting in serious injury and grossly negligent operation of a vehicle, also resulting in serious injury.  He was ordered to appear in court on May 8.  The names and conditions of the three people taken to the hospital have not yet been released.  A witness who was driving to Brattleboro on his way to work said he pulled to the side of the road to make room for an oncoming emergency vehicle with lights flashing and siren blaring. To the witness' amazement, a car split the gap between him and the ambulance.  The witness told the Reformer he watched as the driver of the Audi weaved back and forth, crossing the white and yellow lines at least 15 times.  ""Before the accident he passed two cars in front of me,"" said the witness, who asked that his name not be released. ""He floored it. It looked like (the cars he was passing) were standing still.""  The witness did not see the actual accident but as he was rounding the corner at the future West River Park he saw the two cars spinning in the middle of Route 30 following the impact.  He said as he arrived on the scene, the passenger in the Audi opened his door and fell out onto the pavement, leading to the initial but erroneous report that one person had been ejected during the crash.  The witness said he would have called police, but his mobile phone didn't have a signal.  He was visibly upset by what he had seen.  ""You don't know what you are going to see in terms of the hurt,"" he said. ""You feel the sadness and frustration of knowing that you saw someone not driving responsibly ... and causing an accident.""  Route 30 was closed from about 11:45 p.m. to 6 p.m. as Brattleboro police, assisted by the Vermont State Police, conducted an investigation. Traffic was diverted onto Upper Dummerston Road during that time period.  The Brattleboro Fire Department was assisted by emergency responders from Rescue Inc.  According to police, no additional arrests are expected. "

The first image was created by using several layers, color filters, and adjustments. First I added a normal photo layer, then a brightness layer to bring out the ray of sunlight under my eye. Next I decreased the exposure and readjusted with two more layers to change the brightness. The next layer was a color burn layer to darken the grass and darken and highlight my hair, followed by a hue layer to darken the grass so the eye would not be drawn too much to the left of the image and away from my face. The final layers were color dodge and saturation layers to bring out tones in the color of my eye.  I made these changes to communicate a message about light. I communicated a certain sadness in my expression and the way I took the photograph created a prism effect through my eye. This makes it look like sunlight is falling from my eye as if it were a tear. This represents the first idea of my progression: sometimes crying is necessary to cleanse sadness and to bring light and clarity to a situation. "

As we were walking round we saw this grave of a 15 year old girl who died 8 years ago. The well tended grave, the lanterns, the windchimes and the fresh flowers show how much she must have been loved. The heart shaped border of the inscription and the wording that her no doubt broken hearted parents chose to use moved me incredibly.  The death of a child is something I cannot imagine and my heart goes out to her family.  This sums up heartbreaker for me more than anything else ever could."

After ISIS attacked Sinjar, massacring and enslaving the local Yazidi people, a few of those fortunate enough to escape have sought refuge at the massive Hotel Kayar (literally place where one receives friends). With construction stalled in its early stages, the concrete structure is an inhospitable environment for the 63 Yazidi families who now call it home. Children play with no railing or walls to prevent them from falling.

She was diagnosed with kidney failure (CRF) last August and had barely eaten much over the last two days.  She was uncomfortable and began secluding herself.  I took her to the vet on Friday, May 20.  She has fluid in her abdomen and blood tests revealed that she does have early stage kidney failure but that will not be severe til later on probably a few years from now. She does have fluid in her abdomen.  Fluid retention can be a sign of heart troubles, cancer or something else but Mystery has been having health troubles since August 2010. If it is cancer, then it has had a lot of time to spread.  An x-ray to see what is wrong was taken then later on in June if there is still fluid, perhaps an ultrasound. . She is 15 years old.  If an ultrasound reveals cancer that is operable, such as the spleen then she will need surgery.  Now, Sweet Mystery may have a very uncomfortable and perhaps a short time which I was certainly not expecting.  Perhaps there is a solution, but when Mystery ignores treats like chicken, tuna and salmon that is not a good sign.  Early this Sunday, May 21 just after midnight she ate some chopped up steak.  There is some hope if she can keep this down and digest it as cats cannot go without food for very long.  Had planned to take her in for emergency IV but she was able to eat more then and went in for a check up on Tuesday.  She is my Fur Baby and has been with me as a kitten from three months of age!  Sending my Adorable Girl Healing Rainbows and Hopes of several more years!  Mystery has been back to the vets and received medication for pain and to help remove fluids. Some time in June she will have another check up to see if she still has fluid in the abdomen. It is now June 3rd and in a few days the course of medicine will be finished, then another vet visit.  Many Furry Thanks and Purrs to all for your support and Hopes for Sweet Mystery!"

My family and I took care of this tiny sparrow. We named him ""pi-chan"". Gave some meal, spoke to him, and prepared for comfortable bed.   When I call his name, he always gazed my face. It was very very precious and happy time.  But unfortunately, on the morning of May 31, he's gone to heaven. My family and I were shocked and feeling immeasurable sadness.  I hope that his last days were happy. Thank you pi-chan, we never forget you."

Ballarat's first public cemetery was recorded in 1856, when the first official cemetery burial took place on the 20th May. Local records indicate that whilst this was the first official burial, ceremonies took place in the area of the Old Ballaarat Cemetery in the late 1840's and thereafter, which was even before the discovery of gold in Ballarat and the subsequent Gold Rushes that drew people to the city from around the world.   Allow the elegant and ornate Victorian gates on the corner of Macarthur Street and Creswick Road to usher you into a world of grand and simple monuments to the dead, and to a slice of Ballarat's fantastic history.  The Old Ballaarat Cemetery is filled with historical figures from Ballarat's past as many burials were early settlers who were looking to make their fortune on the goldfields. People mentioned in my own photostream are amongst those buried here; Richard Henry Sutton of Sutton's Music Store in Sturt Street; George and Clara Crocker who dedicated windows in St Peter's Church of England to their sons who died during the Great War; Thomas Stoddart who made Ballarat a city of marble statues; and Henry Richards Caselli who designed so many beautiful and iconic Ballarat buildings.  Two important monuments in not just Ballarat's, but Australia's, history were erected in the cemetery following from the armed insurrection of 1854 - the Eureka uprising; the Eureka Diggers' Monument in 1856 and the Officers and Soldiers Monument in 1879.  Situated in the centre of the cemetery, is the original Victorian rotunda built in 1892 to the designs of James and Piper and J. C. Smith.  The Rotunda has recently been restored to its original splendour.  Cemetery records show 35,000 interments have taken place since 1856, with 18,000 prior to 1884.
