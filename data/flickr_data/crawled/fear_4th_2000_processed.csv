I had been watching a hairy woodpecker nest hole in our crab tree for several weeks prior to the storm on June 30. The hole was only about 7 feet above the ground, and I could hear the chicks peeping. A large branch fell and another had to be cut while the chicks were in the nest, and there was plenty of other human activity. But nothing seemed to disturb the happy family. The chicks must have been close to leaving, and I fear this may be a fledgling who got thrashed in the wicked weather. I didn't have the heart to move it. It can be a very rough world."

Every night this happened, I'd get into bed, then see the thing sitting there. The foot of my bed was right next to my door, and they would often be somewhere between the door and my bed, so I'd sometimes be so terrified I couldn't even scream for my parents to come and get rid of it, for fear of the thing falling/jumping onto me.

WEBSITE / FACEBOOK / TWITTER / BEHIND THE SCENES / LIMITED EDITION PRINTS  The idea behind this image comes from the complete impatience I have waiting for the snow to come! We had a very nice Christmas at our house and I ate a great many treats! I wont deny that there were lonely times as well. My partner Sam was away for Christmas visiting his family.  I had plenty of times to work out some interesting concept ideas in my sketchbook! This is one of them. For me a red breasted robin epitomises all of the emotions I associate with winter and the snow. As I stared out of the window on Christmas morning at a wet and dull day this idea come to my mind. I love that the subject is devoid of identity, I think it symbolises the desire and impatience that each of us have while wondering when snow may fall. I didnt want to photograph to be about just one person, I wanted it to represent everyone. Although snow comes with the obvious inconveniences and hazards we all have memories of the fun and joy of playing in the snow. A day hasnt gone by in the past month when someone hasnt given their snow day prediction to me! I hope it comes soon."

The next morning I started with a party of natives to seek elephants.We held along the banks of the Lotsane for several miles, holding a north-westerly course; after which we left the river and held south-west; and,at last, followed down to the Limpopo, and so home to camp, withoutfinding a single fresh spoor.

With the help of a few school friends, he quickly initiated himself to the mystery of spray cans on his neighborhood walls until Henry Chalfant and Martha Coopers Subway Art and Spraycan Art definitely converted him to the noble art.  After moving to the South of France for a few years, Bom.k returned to live in Paris and created the Da Mental Vaporz in 1999 with Iso and Kan.

With the new century, the crew opened up to a new generation of painters in the 2000 years, welcoming artists like Jaws, Gris1, Brusk and Dran and more recently Sowat and Blo in its ranks. Together, the 9 members of this iconoclast collective traveled the world, England, Spain, Denmark, Belgium and Australia, to participate to numerous festivals, put together ambitious DIY shows and above all, paint whatever comes in there way.  .....toOo Continue Reading knowngallery.com/exhibitions/current/  Opening reception January 11, 2014 | 8-11pm On view: January 11 - 25, 2014  GrosleFotoGraff 2014  www.Flickr.com/Groslee www.Tumblr.com/13eyesss  DMV crew website www.damentalvaporz.com/  Graffiti Futurism write up Bom.k has always been one of a kind in Frances Graffiti scene.

I wanted to show the emotion that people go through in life when it doesn't go their way; showing that they ""drown"" in their own chaos. Whenever student does badly in a class or test, they feel as if they had hit rock bottom and just drowning in their own worries. Grownups in this world are going into debt and can't keep up with paying their bills and feel as if they are drowning in debt.   My work demonstrates the exploration of my ideas by showing pictures of the ideal image of drowning. My idea behind this concept is to show the emotion and the desperation. My idea for this assignment was having my model in water getting the impression that they are, or have drowned. I made the pictures not have much color because I wanted to express a sad mood. I had a light bulb and window lighting used to get dark shadows on the objects to also get a sad and dark mood. The image above and the other one like this in the fish tank show fear and being stuck. Sometimes when we have financial troubles or life isn't going the way we want it to go, we just feel stuck. The picture of the face out of water is showing that she looks dead. That she gave up on life and continued to drown till the end. The one picture with my little sister with the blurry water on her shows that is so close of getting out of her drowning phase. The one with her just laying in the water shows serenity. These pictures portray different aspects of depression. "

Carlijn Mens (1972) legt schaduwen vast en tekent het licht. De resultaten zijn soms gelukmakend: schaduwen van takken op een zomerse dag of haar dochter die danst met haar eigen schaduw. Bij Faith Fear Face het project in progress dat zij speciaal voor het GEM realiseert, dient het licht als metafoor voor de strijd om te overleven en het gevecht voor een beter leven. De installatie gaat over het ontnemen van vrijheid en is gebaseerd op het onderzoek dat Mens het afgelopen jaar heeft gedaan naar de internationale dramas van mensensmokkel. Maar het gaat verder: het werk refereert ook aan de eeuwige zoektocht van de mens. Het resultaat is indrukwekkend en beklemmend.   Het ontnemen van vrijheid is iets van alle tijden. Bij het maken van Faith Fear Face vormde de bekende Dover-zaak uit 2000, waarbij 58 Chinezen in een container om het leven kwamen, de rode draad. In een enorme tekening - circa 15 meter breed en 2,40 meter hoog - wordt een container doorgelicht om verstekelingen te traceren. Om het effect van rntgenfotografie  waarmee containers worden doorgelicht - te bereiken, heeft Mens het lichaam gebruikt om afdrukken te maken van de menselijke figuur. Ze geeft een gezicht aan deze onzichtbare, anonieme wereld en blijft zo dicht mogelijk bij de realiteit. Door Mens wordt het onmenselijke menselijk gemaakt.   Ze zoekt in haar werk naar tegenstellingen: donker en licht, werkelijkheid en illusie, goed en kwaad, recht en onrecht, leven en dood. Het licht staat voor hoop en/of de illusie van een beter leven, terwijl schaduwen laten zien wat er werkelijk gebeurt. Faith Fear Face refereert aan begrippen die Mens tijdens haar onderzoek veelvuldig tegenkwam. Faith staat voor geloof en vertrouwen in de toekomst, Fear voor angst en ontzag voor gezag en Face voor gezichtsverlies en schaamte. Mens onderbouwt haar getekende beelden met het onderzoek waarbij zij medewerking kreeg van politie, Openbaar Ministerie, Forensisch Instituut en Vluchtelingenwerk. Op die manier maakt ze de omvang van deze schrijnende onzichtbare wereld duidelijk.   Ook bij eerdere projecten van Mens draait het om schaduw en licht. Zo heeft ze in het project Preserved Places papier uitgerold in het bos om plekken te documenteren die ze wil behouden en beschermen. In het project Preserving the Artist legt ze de schaduwen vast van een generatie kunstenaars die haar gevormd heeft, kunstenaars die bepalend zijn in de kunstgeschiedenis. Dit is voor haar een persoonlijke noodzaak. Bij het maken van de schaduwportretten, ontdekte Mens de bizarre verpersoonlijking van de mens in zijn schaduw. De schaduw kan alleen van die persoon zijn, net zoals DNA, rntgenfotos en vingerafdrukken. Vanuit die gedachte is het project voor het GEM ontstaan.   Theres something odd about shadows. There and yet not there. In her drawings, Carlijn Mens (b. 1972) captures shadows and depicts light. The results are sometimes joyful: shadows of branches on a summer day or her daughter dancing with her own shadow. But in her current project for the GEM, Faith Fear Face, light serves as a metaphor for the struggle to survive and the battle for a better life. The installation is about the deprivation of liberty and is based on the inquiry that Mens has conducted over the past year into the international tragedy of people smuggling. But it goes further than that: the work also refers to mankinds never-ending quest to better its condition. The result is both impressive and disturbing.   The deprivation of liberty is a perennial phenomenon. The notorious case in which 58 Chinese people were found dead in a shipping container at Dover in 2000 is the key motif in Faith Fear Face. A vast drawing  around 15 metres wide and 2.4 metres high  shows a container being scanned to detect stowaways. To create the effect of X-ray photography (now used to scan containers), Mens uses body prints to represent human figures. She lends this invisible, anonymous world a human face and adheres as closely as possible to reality. Mens (whose name actually means human being in Dutch) renders the inhuman human.   In her work, Mens looks for contrasts: dark and light, reality and illusion, good and evil, justice and injustice, life and death. Light stands for hope and/or the illusion of a better life, whereas shadows reveal what is really happening. The title Faith Fear Face is an allusion to terms that Mens encountered repeatedly during her inquiry. Faith stands for belief and confidence in the future, Fear for anxiety and dread of the authorities, and Face for degradation and shame. Mens uses the results of her research (conducted with the cooperation of the police, Public Prosecution Service, Netherlands Forensic Institute and Dutch Council for Refugees) in support of the images in her drawings. By doing so, she reveals the extent of this harrowing hidden world.   Earlier projects also revolved around shadow and light. In her Preserved Places project, for example, Mens rolled out lengths of paper in woodland areas to record places she wants to preserve and protect. In the Preserving the Artist project, she creates shadow portraits of a generation of artists who have influenced her, artists who have had a decisive impact on the history of art. For her, this is a personal necessity. While recording these shadows, Mens has discovered the bizarre identification of the person and his shadow: like DNA, X-ray photos and fingerprints, shadows are unique to the individual. The present project for the GEM was born of that realization.   Carlijn Mens studied at the AKV / St. Joost in s Hertogenbosch and graduated from the Dutch Art Institute (DAI) in Enschede. She currently lives and works in Schoorl and Den Helder."

Scanned with epson 750 Pro   Niccol dellArca (c. 1435-1440  2 March 1494), also known as Niccol da Ragusa, Niccol da Bari and Niccol d'Antonio d'Apulia, being probably born in Apulia (the old name for an Italian region), or perhaps in Bari. The surname dellArca refers to his contribution to the Arca di San Domenico. Mentioned in  1462 in Bologna as Maestro Nicol da Puglia, a master of terracotta figures, this term refers to the Compianto sul Cristo morto, a terracotta group in the Sanctuary of Santa Maria della Vita in Bologna. Six separate figures (the three Mary, Saint John diciple, and Giuseppe dArimatea) stand shouting and mourning around the dead Christ, who lies on the ground. The realism of their dramatic facial details, strictly fits the intents of the physiognomic studies, by which the artist conveys the souls movements through the mimic of the face. The date of this sculpture is uncertain: c. 1460, or even some date it between 1485 and 1490. Here the shout of the man facing the death, the suffering for disease, becomes stone to be able to come back a shout in the flesh of the observer. An aggressive, brute and  unredeemed shout, at the origin of the experience of mankind. This sculpture has been made for a hospital, witnessing something of which the sculptor certainly made experience. How this shouting can be turned into a crying, free from fear and anguish, where the unbearable pain is changed in a peaceful suffering, is a leading issue in the care for the diseased men. A resonance of that peace within the drama, where the tears drop for emotion, but lack of that evil anguish can be heard in the Responsories for the Holy Week, by Tomas Luis Da Victoria. Here the Caligaverunt is the song which better says this feeling. www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEGGvlLTuh0 "

Oliveira was born in Recife, Brazil, on December 25, 1867. His mother was from Recife and his father was from the Portuguese city of Porto. In 1873, the family moved to Lisbon, where Oliveira graduated from the Faculty of Letters (today part of the University of Lisbon) in 1888 with a degree in classical and modern literature.   Oliveira began working as a journalist at the age of 14, when he founded ""Correio do Brazil"", a monthly journal published in Lisbon. His articles criticized the hold that oligarchs had over the newly founded Brazilian Republic and so gained fame as a republican. He graduated from the Faculty of Letters at the University of Lisbon in 1887, and in 1890 began working for the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He served as a diplomat in Portugal, Belgium, Germany, Japan, and the United States.  He also led the first Brazilian diplomatic business mission to Japan in 1901.  He was nominated but not confirmed as ambassador to the United Kingdom. His nomination was subtly opposed by the British after Oliviera said Brazil should remain neutral in World War I.  He also made enemies in Brazil after opposing the country's expansionist policies (such as the annexation of the Peruvian state of Acre, which was proposed by Jos Paranhos, Baron of Rio Branco).  He argued that Brazil expansion should only come through trade.  Oliveira loved to write. A Germanophile, he loved German philosophy and wrote extensively on the topic. He authored three books on Japan, and a biography of Joo VI (King of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves from 1816 to 1822).  He cultivated a number of authors as friends, including Gilberto Freyre and a young Machado de Assis.  Fond of books, Oliveira collected the third-largest library in Brazil, smaller only than the National Library of Brazil and the Library of the University of So Paulo. First secretary of the Brazilian legation at the Brazilian embassy in the United States beginning in 1896, he brought his library with him.  He donated the 40,000-volume collection to the Catholic University of America (CUA) in 1916 out of a fear that it would not receive adequate care in Brazil. For the next four years, Oliveira also acted as the collection's librarian and curator.  The Olivera Lima Collection library holds books, serials, pamphlets, maps and broadsides, as well as more than 700 manuscripts.  It is a unique collection of Portuguese chronicles from the age of exploration; histories of Portuguese religious orders; important works and original documents about the social, cultural, and diplomatic history of 19th-century Portugal and Brazil; and the complete works of a wide range of Portuguese and Brazilian writers. The library also houses the Oliveira Lima Family Papers; 60 volumes of scrapbooks containing Oliveira's writings; and a collection of art, maps, and 19th- and early 20th-century photographs. The Oliveira Lima Collection is considered the finest collection of Luso-Brazilian materials in the U.S.  There is no other specialized collection of comparable depth anywhere else in the world -- particularly for the study of Portuguese expansion in the 16th century and for the social and cultural history of Brazil from the arrival of the Portuguese court (1808) to 1930.  From 1923 until his death in 1928, Oliveira served as professor of international law at CUA. In 1924, he was appointed Honorary Professor of the Faculty of Law of Recife.  Oliveira married Flora de Oliveira Lima (ne Cavalcanti de Albuquerque). Oliveira died suddenly at his home in Washington, D.C., on March 24, 1928. He was buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery.  His tombstone does not include his name; rather, it is inscribed with the Portugese phrase ""Aqui jaz um amigo dos livros"" (Here lies a friend of books). "

I find myself in the Taza area, just south of Kirkuk, on the road to Baghdad. According to them, very few journalists come here. Some even said that I was the only was they saw. Nonetheless, it is a key strategic location. It is very dangerous there since Kirkuk is divided: Kurds in the north, ISIS in the south. All along the front lines you can see different units roaming about little traditional houses. Some are kept by old Kurdish vets from the 1980s wars. Many vets have returned to war, despite being well past middle-aged and having children and grandchildren. Some even behind comfortable lives in Europe to come back, like a Swiss colonel I met. For them, it is their duty to fight for their region. Despite being autonomous and having a large secessionist movement, Kurdistan is not recognized as a state distinct from Iraq. Some terrorists come along and now the whole world calls them the Islamic State, complains one peshmerga, For decades we have been trying to make the state of Kurdistan and weve gotten nothing! They have very few weapons, most of them are pre-Cold War AK47s. Some even date back to 1960. They still work, but the Kurdish forces ask for more efficient guns since ISIS has the latest weapons taken (or given) from the Iraqi army who in turn was supplied by coalition forces. Many vets have only one working eye. The other was lost in previous wars. Once night falls, it becomes very difficult to monitor the 1000km long border. They dont even have night vision equipment. Last week it rained for 5 days, and it was impossible to see or hear anything. Some ISIS guys tried to gain territory, but the Kurds successfully fought them off. Their 4 wheel drives were stuck in the mud while ISISs brand new hummers were able to move about without issue. From the front line you can see ISIS flags. Since they told me to pack light, I didnt bring a zoom lens. Sorry! You can see the smoke from their kitchen and even see men running from house to house. ISIS is only 500 meters from the Kurdish position but nobody seems afraid. Peshmerga know that death is part of their fate, and even if they look like an army from another century, they will defend themselves and their country to the very end. For them, it is the highest honor to die for Kurdistan. They protect the Baghdad road, but a few weeks ago lost it. After heavy fighting, they regained it, killing 3 Chechen ISIS fighters in the process. Since peshmerga dont have armored cars, it is very dangerous for them to go around safely. The car I took to go on the front lines was very slow and made in the 80s. If we were chased by ISIS cars, we wouldnt have stood a chance. In one day, all the materiel I saw included AK47s, a tank, an RPG, and a few gun old machines. Even if the pehsmergas say that this equipment works well, they are disappointed not to receive new ones, as Europe and USA promised. The day after my visit, France made lot of bombings in the area, as ISIS was too close. Peshmergas take a lot of pictures, not only for souvenirs, but also to fight ISIS on the new front: social media. They fear the roads they do not know well as ISIS pays the local farmers to put mines. Even in times of war, peshmergas are among the most welcoming people in the world. They regularly offer food and drinks. When it was time for me to go back to the safety of Erbil, circumstances changed. The north road was closed because of an ISIS attack. The only way out was to send me through the south road that crossed Kirkuk. Lets just say that safety there was not ideal. I had to hide my camera, and we crossed Kirkuk with an escort of armed peshmergas and a civilian car. The soldiers were all nervous since Kirkuk is very dangerous, especially at the check points. As soon as a car was driving next to ours for too long, they were shouting at the driver to go away. If a man was crossing the road too slowly, they threatened to hit him. These methods, employed by ISIS suicide bombers, have claimed the lives of hundred in Kirkuk. Once on the Kurdish side, they found a Kurdish taxi driver to bring me safely back to Erbil.
