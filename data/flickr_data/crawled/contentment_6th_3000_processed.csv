I just picked up some Graduated ND Filter's and a holder.  I noticed when shooting in the Marin Headlands a few weeks ago I was in dire need of them for blown out foregrounds due to city lights.  Since I am not the most avid day shooter....I never saw a need for the filters until then.  Now that I have them its going to take some serious practice to figure them out and apply them properly.  I think I took close to 45 shots out on the beach and maybe 2 came out as acceptable (not to be confused with contentment) to me.  This was shot at sunset (duh) with a .6 Grad ND filter with a soft edge.....I am not brave enough or good enough yet to try a hard edge....  I'm sorta kicking myself for not moving the camera around a little bit in the foreground pool.  I probably could have gotten an excellent reflection rather than a small shadow and black water.  Live and learn.  Shot was taken at an odd 13mm focal length 6 seconds @ f11 ISO 200 Canon 40d and a Sigma 10-20mm lense with a UV filter as well  View On Black  <-----------------------------------best choice

Highlights include the irresistible blues-tinged hit, ""Irreparably Yours"" and the palpable nostalgia of the cross-country driving tune ""Long Lost Ghosts."" Emily's fervent crooning uplifts in ""My Favorite Part,"" ""Silent Conversations,"" and ""I Won't Tell a Soul.""  For the first time in a long time, she trades in her regular heartbreaker imagery for a welcome dose of contentment in ""Brand New,"" ""Skipping Stones,"" and ""Easy Call.""  The songsmith sings it like she feels it.  Over the course of her eight full-length studio albums, Emily's singer-songwriter stylings have effortlessly fused pure vocals and chillingly sparse music with chamber pop, indie soul, and gypsy jazz.  On Long Lost Ghosts, she does what she does best: combining acoustic instruments and vivid nature metaphorssinging of winter wheat, crickets, gravel roads, and skylarksto connect with her audience.    The lilt in her voice is as endearing as ever, and the support of her backing band enhances without distracting from the delicate and hopeful vibe that has come to define Emily Hurds music.  Lush vocals, vibrant acoustic production, and tones of defiant optimism run through all the songs on Long Lost Ghosts, echoing the uptempo balladry and intelligent anthems, often linked to kindred troubadours Lyle Lovett and Steve Earle.  Emily wrote the songs on her ukulele and recorded them on the vintage grand piano at Chicagos King Size Sound Labs.  The record features an all-star line-up of Chicago musicians: John Abbey (Robbie Fulks, Amy Speace), Darren Garvey (Cameron McGill and What Army, Miles Nielsen), Sue Demel (Sons of the Never Wrong, Come Sunday), and Maria McCullough (Sleepy Lou, Jonas Friddle).    Emily Hurd is an inspirational national indie act, performing for growing pockets of loyal followers who revel in her ample cache of new and old original songs.  She's shared the stage and/or opened for Irma Thomas, Bettye Lavette, Roger McGuinn, and Ozomatli. Her music is featured on the popular CBS crime drama NCIS.  She plays live on WGN TV and radio, WXRT radio, amongst other acclaimed Chicago music institutions.  She appears on the prestigious Old Town School of Folk Music ""Songbook"" collection (released by Bloodshot Records).  She is a winner/finalist in the John Lennon Songwriting Contest, NPR's NewSong Contest, and The International Songwriting Competition.   Her supporters in the Southeast run the annual Emilyfest in an open barn down in a holler of rural North Carolina.  The big skies and high country grass at Emilyfest serve as the perfect backdrop for her fans to listen and lose themselves for a while in her inimitable lyrics. Just listen... "

The clothes are lovely to wear and they become my statement to anyone who notices me that I wear skirts and dresses because I am supposed to be a woman and these clothes also validate the same point to me. It is as that realisation kicks in that the emotions within are released and this fuels the true contentment that comes from expressing my true self. I do so wish that I could look like this every day.

We traveled around the city and did a number of touristy things there, including shopping and browsing many, many stores. Often, I get so caught up in trying to find the perfect outfit for myself or the perfect gift for someone else and am reminded of how much we fret over material things in life. I believe that we live in an increasingly difficult age where things have become too immediate and readily accessible that we grow numb to the future and what lies ahead, even beyond our own timeline.

Up there I know a Muslim family who works on the dyeing process of the famous silk Banarsi sarees. In this timeless and magical place, there is an amazing and contagious happiness among everyone and I always leave this opened workshop with a real feeling of contentment. Maybe this happens because of the colours, colours are everything to me and working all day with colours seems to be the most beautiful job. People there became my friends, they are in a different world, away from a kind of modernity and they show an absence of artificiality. They bear a real kindness in everything they do and say which is naturaly the true nature of innocence. I come there and take pictures at regular times almost every season and I always give them some prints that they enjoy. The night before I took this picture we met by chance along the Ganges and they invited me for dinner at their place. They dont speak English so I have to attempt to speak Urdu and each time it allows me to nelieve that I have been progressing a little. That day was one of the hotest of the year and after his work this young man wanted to take a shower in order to look clean with a fresh shirt and a nice hair style for a kind of official portrait that he asked me to make. I started a few shots before, trying to catch that happiness and innocence. He gave me more as usual with this generous smile like he did last December with another portrait. www.flickr.com/photos/designldg/3081144494/in/set-7215761...

No. A cheese grater does not make lemonade, but often the processes that I suspect that will lead to my intended result end up creating something completely different: and something exactly as it's meant to be.   Lately I have been finding that life will throw me a bundle of resources, a lemon for the sake of this metaphor. I often have elaborate ideas for exactly how things are meant to go and just the right way to conduct things, or how I want to make nachos supreme from the lemon I was given. Ultimately, I go through the trials and errors, trying to grate the lemon into cheddar cheese, only to find that I get to the result that fate intended all along and I've made perfectly good lemonade from my lemon. The humility then comes from realizing that the learning was in the process, and contentment with the final product is what's important. So spike that lemonade and enjoy Happy Hour, because ""It's 5 o'clock somewhere"".

But instead of bringing my stress home with me, or looking somewhere outside myself for inspiration, I went backwards.  I thought of all the things I wanted, the ""dreams"" that had never been fulfilled, the goals I'd set for myself but not completed.  I thought about all the ""wishes"" ""wants"" the ""would haves.""    And I realized that that list is pretty short these days.  It's not necessarily that what I have is so different, but that I've started to be more content with where I am in the world now.    And this quote really hit home for me, realizing that I'm shifting from a place of constant wanting, constant wishing... into a place of relative contentment and satisfaction.  I have a roof over my  head, a housemate who is lovely and loving and supportive.  I have family near and far who I am so close to.  I have a good, stable, steady job.  I make enough to pay my bills and still do a lot of the things I love to do.  I am talented and passionate, I have friends and coworkers that I enjoy and appreciate.   And I have goals and wishes and dreams that sustain me, instead of draining me.    So yes, contentment.  I'm at a contented point in my life-- even amidst the stress and strain of our busy busy summer season.  Because there is so much more in my life and in my heart than just this momentary stress.

New days full of eager audiences waiting in breathless anticipation, the bleachers are always full.  Popcorn and cotton candy in the bellies of happy children.  But the arena is empty and the air is stifled with the thick blanket of indifference.  The soil stained with the blood of old soldiers, ghosts of the soulless regime. Intoxicating viewpoints, seducing entire civilizations.  Fallen Angels laughing at collective religious ignorance.Working, striving, accelerating, trying to keep up.  Thank God for the fire, the warmness and contentment.  Images of light coming to meet me.  A happy reunion, a friend long lost, victims of bad timing.  Lonely travels down the forlorn path Antecedents reminding me of how I could have done it better.  For the only way out is up and the only way up is through the fire.  Redwood trees and granite lead the way though it hardly seems real.  Watching in hiding, listening to the maddening sound of their voices singing through the air, shrill and hollow.  Singing a song about me.  Dancing naked knee deep in my blood.  Ruthless killers couldnt do better this,  though that is of little comfort now. Biting at the heels of contentment, Energy made manifest, seems like matter has betrayed universal law  Im not really sure what that means.  Probably nothing of consequence. Generations lamentations, devastations, spasmodic earth ever changing, rearranging, decks of cards not in order.  Chaotic scrimmages fighting against an invisible enemy steadily marching forward, never looking back.  Steady streams of malcontent effortlessly winding down the forlorn path.  Writhing under the pressure of time, withering bloody corpses of yesterday, today, tomorrow.  Existence as we know it ceases without warning, followed by evolutions, revolutions, new species doomed to repeat our past.  "

I edited this picture to bleach out the surrounding and leave only Pep, because that's what our interaction feels like to me, particularly when I am stressed or overwhelmed.  Pep, in some ways, reminds me of the woodchopper. Thoreau found the man to be ""so quiet and solitary and so happy withal; a well of good humor and contentment which overflowed at his eyes""(138). With Pep, there is no need to make small talk (which we all know Thoreau hated). We can just be in each other's company, neither of us has to do or say anything. We can just sit in proximity to each other be content."

contentment,http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6175/6166142667_926fedd22d_z.jpg,1,4,"Some Thoughts on Smoking I once read that cannabis is a 'gateway' drug, that its use leads to the use of more illicit drugs. In fact there is no scientific consensus on the truth of that suggestion, but my experience was rather the opposite, that it led to the use of a less illicit (as in socially taboo, but in fact more dangerous) drug, namely tobacco.  Shortly after I was born my Dad gave up smoking but, despite repeated attempts, my Mum wasn't able to do the same. My gran still has a letter which I wrote to her at the age of seven which reads ""Dear Nana, Mum says she will definitely give up smoking this time!"" The sight of her father, my grandpa - a smoker for fifty years - on his nebuliser to mitigate the symptoms of his emphysema finally steeled her will and she kicked the habit. I was 14, and having lived with it all those years made me hate them: I was certain that I would never even so much as try a cigarette and, in spite of a fascination with and appreciation of the way it looked (which, as you can tell, continues to this day), I wouldn't at that time have dreamed of dating anyone who touched them.  Weed, however, was another matter: when I was in my late teens and a few friends and I would occasionally get together to smoke weed, I would have to be reminded each time the joint came to me how to smoke. Years later, during a night out when I was twenty one, someone handed me a cigarette and, without even thinking, I took a draw. I realised then that so much of the pleasure I had taken from smoking cannabis was not because of the cannabis, but because of the smoking.   It became a regular thing. My attitude to my smoking was conceited, I was self-congratulatory about it. I felt that I had started to smoke for the right reasons: not because my friends pressured me, which they didn't (we were too old then for that), and not to look good or cool (Lord knows I don't, unlike so many of my friends, suit a cigarette), and I didn't smoke because I needed to. I was not addicted. I smoked one a day, and I did it because I enjoyed it: those beautiful few minutes after dinner when, all alone, I would light up, reflect, and separate the stresses of the day from the evening that was to follow. The Frasier character Bebe Glazer has summed up the joy of smoking in this hilarious clip: www.youtube.com/watch?v=B75qAZC1Bnk  And while I genuinely believe that smoking can be a wonderful thing - Beryl Bainbridge called tobacco ""the handmaiden of creativity"", to which I can relate - addiction, disease and smelling bad are not wonderful things. I've been a smoker for four years now, and the number of cigarettes I smoke each day has increased at the rate of one a year: these days, I probably average around five a day, and for the past year or so I've been trying to cut back. I always thought that five a day was too many and, by the time I reached that point, I would have one before my breakfast on some mornings.  I've always said, and continue to say, that I will never quit. There may, for all I know, come a time when I won't have smoked a cigarette for a year but, even on that day, I will still consider myself a smoker. I don't want to stop smoking, but I would love to go back to that first year when I smoked one after dinner each night and that was all.   Or perhaps, to take it further, I would love to smoke like Fraser here. Once every couple of weeks, on a night or a day out, he will ask me for a cigarette, continue to smoke them for that day or night, and then that will be the last I will see of him smoking for another couple of weeks, perhaps even a month. I remember hearing a character in a film say that she smokes ""only in times of extreme stress or contentment"" and I liked that idea.  I don't mean to promote or glamourise smoking. I know its risks and the harm it can cause, but I also know the joy and pleasure of smoking: it is a truly deep pleasure, like holding someone's hand and looking into their eyes, not a superficial pleasure like eating a sweetie. As with so much in life, it is about finding the balance - and that balance will be different in each person - between what we want, what we need, and what are able to handle.  Glasgow, 2011.

My story, your story, God's story, our story. Story. It is in the fiber of my very being. A dominant thread used when He knit me together in my mother's womb. I simply must share stories that bring tears, both of laughter and intense pain. And I will settle for no less in the pictures that I take. The elements of a good story. As a chapter title in Donald Miller's book states, ""A Character Who Wants Something and Overcomes Conflict to Get It."" Perhaps that is why I am so enamored with the play of light and shadow {darkness} in a photograph. Why I am so compelled by black and white photography. Because somewhere in the photo, the light will overpower, and perhaps ""blow out"" the darkness. But the light is only made beautiful by the shadow that surrounds it. That's life - the picture of hope.  Sure I love a nice color photo, but more often than not I am moved by black and white photography. Especially black and white candids. Where a fleeting moment is frozen forever. The eyes, not necessarily staring directly at the camera but instead catching a glimpse of the beauty of a life - pain, joy, contentment, struggle - within the eyes. The gentle touch of hand on a bare shoulder. The exchange of a knowing glance between two lovers and friends. The interaction between people who truly know each other and yet choose to love in spite of that. The inexpressible joy on a Mama's face as she looks upon her beloved little one. The dirt forever trapped in a little boy's neck rolls. The belly laughs. The favorite toys. The tantrums. The story of life. Human emotion. Real. Raw. You can't pose that. And as my hero Tara Whitney puts it, ""Imperfectly perfect."" Those are the photos that I find myself intensely studying. Wanting desperately to capture for myself, my family and my friends. The perfect gift. Yourself as you are, and as your loved ones want to remember you.  The photos above ARE my critter. And I love her. They are not technically perfect - too much ""noise"" and some dreaded ""blown out"" spots. But those imperfections are a beautiful part of our story. The realness makes me weak. "

Being a dad is no different. There are some times when strong wills and impending tantrums prompt me to feel as though - to quote singer Steven Curtis Chapman - ""I'd trade 'em for a Diet Coke."" Other times, when the surface of the day ripples with contentment and smiles warm the coldest corner of my heart, I'd trade everything else in the world to stay in the moment forever.  Today's Daily Shoot assignment - ""Sugar, spice, and everything nice. Make a photo of something sweet today"" - took my mind not to confections but to the place where life is as perfect as it gets this side of eternity: the love and security of being with my family in a moment of happiness.  That's the best kind of sweetness. "

The name ""Sai"" was given to him upon his arrival at Shirdi, a town in the west-Indian state of Maharashtra. Mahalsapati, a local temple priest, recognized him as a Muslim saint and greeted him with the words 'Ya Sai!', meaning 'Welcome Sai!'. Sai or Sayi is a Persian title given to Sufi saints, meaning 'poor one'. However S may also refer to the Sanskrit term ""Sakshat Eshwar"" or the divine. The honorific ""Baba"" means ""father; grandfather; old man; sir"" in Indo-Aryan languages. Thus Sai Baba denotes ""holy father"", ""saintly father"" or ""poor old man"".   Sai Baba remains a very popular saint, especially in India, and is worshipped by people around the world. He had no love for perishable things and his sole concern was self-realization. He taught a moral code of love, forgiveness, helping others, charity, contentment, inner peace, and devotion to God and guru. Sai Baba's teaching combined elements of Hinduism and Islam: he gave the Hindu name Dwarakamayi to the mosque he lived in, practiced Hindu and Muslim rituals, taught using words and figures that drew from both traditions, and was buried in Shirdi. One of his well known epigrams, ""Sabka Malik Ek "" (""One God governs all""), is associated with Islam and Sufism. He always uttered ""Allah Malik""(""God is King""). "

My inspiration came from Edward Hopper, and his painting 'High Noon'.  For me, this painting evokes feelings of isolation and intrigue.  Hopper uses cool colours and sharp contrasts, with a blue sky surrounding the house.  The lone woman in the painting stands at the doorway and the windows are predominantly dark with the curtains drawn.  I wanted to portray the same feelings of loneliness and isolation within my series.  In all of the images, Anna is looking out, beyond the confines of her house and garden, but never ventures beyond the white picket fence, a metaphor for seemingly 'perfect' middle class suburban living.  I wanted to hint at a feeling of seclusion and entrapment, to contrast with the feelings of contentment that we expect to be synonymous with owning a comfortable home in a safe neighbourhood."

Birthdays are (since 2008) always bad days for me... getting older in this country is not a very good thing.  Employers discriminate WIDELY on age and so ... growing old 'gracefully' is not always applicable.   the day is almost thru.   I hope to one day feel good enough about myself and my situation...so that i can enjoy a birthday again. I haven't 'celebrated' in a while...last year i distracted myself by spending way too much money in a bar in amsterdam. was fun but ..wasn't fun afterwards trying to figure out how to pay bills....:P temporary contentment i suppose...learned from that lesson!!   anyhoes.... this is the crisis some of us must live with...and others fail to believe even exists.   funny how that happens.

It wasn't that I don't like to work... it's just that I had to work early and that pretty much kept me from being Viewminder last night.  I was tired... sore and a little cranky.  Then I popped Brennetta.  The woman just lit my morning up.  Usually I don't pop people when I'm working because I've been able to keep my secret double lives distinctly seperated.  Brennetta and I had a great conversation.  We laughed at the absurdities of life.  I told her how much it sucked sometimes to be the boss.  We came to the conclusion that I need to 'be a better pimp.'  That made me visualize myself coming to work in a more 'pimpin'' outfit.  Of course I'll need some more brightly colored suits...  a little more bling...  and a couple of outrageous hats.  I think I smiled all morning after that talk.  Brennetta said that I've got the soul of a black man.  She said she could see it the second I walked into the building.  Brennetta dug this picture and I broke protocol and gave her a card.  We talked a little bit about shooting the street.  'It's your spirit' Brennetta said 'you're like a renegade angel... you bring that out in people.'  You soaked my morning in sunshine girl!  You're beautiful...  and you got a beautiful soul.  Thank you.  I hope I gave a little back.  We're all on the same journey.  It's Hard Out Here

Hotei  has a cheerful face and a big belly. He is supposedly based on an actual person, and is widely recognized outside of Japan as the Fat, Laughing Buddha. He carries a large cloth bag over his back (Nunobukuro , lit. = cloth bag), one that never empties, for he uses it to feed the poor and needy. It includes an inexhaustible cache of treasures, including food and drink. Indeed, the Japanese spelling of Hotei literally means cloth bag. He also holds a Chinese fan called an oogi  (said to be a wish giving fan -- in the distant past, this type of fan was used by the aristocracy to indicate to vassals that their requests would be granted). Hotei is most likely based on the itinerant 10th-century Chinese Buddhist monk and hermit Budaishi , who is said to be an incarnation of Miroku Bodhisattva (Maitreya in Sanskrit).   Hotei is sometimes shown surrounded by a group of small children, romping and squealing in delight around his rotund shape.  In recent times, Hotei is also referred to as the patron saint of restaurateurs and bartenders. When one over eats and over drinks, one may sometimes jokingly attribute it to Hoteis influence."

If you urge them to acquire and achieve, they will learn to cheat and steal to meet your expectations. Encourage you children's deepest joys, not their superficial desires. Praise their patience, not their ambition. Do not value the distractions and diversions that masquerade as success. They will learn to hear their own voice instead of the noise of the crowd.

It represents great enthusiasm for learning and discovery and the peace and contentment of fulfilling a promise to ones self. In bringing concepts to reality we continuously satisfy a desire to express ourselves in life and learn new skills.  Financial gain from using your talents wisely is a key message too. We are warned, however not to neglect or misuse our abilities. Worst of all would be to not recognize our possibilities.   Great talents are the most lovely and often the most dangerous fruits on the tree of humanity. They hang upon the most slender twigs that are easily snapped off. - Carl Jung "

These Lovebirds are highly social in nature and are characteristically noisy. Noise symbolizes contentment. African Lovebirds are intelligent and they are better off alone or in pairs. These birds do not usually live in colonies because they tend to fight with each other if they do not get enough space for themselves.  African Lovebirds are small parrots. They are stout, colorful little parrots about 13 cm long with a short rounded tail. They are dimorphic too, male having a grey mask, just like the black mask in masked lovebirds. The bill is light colored and feet are light grey. The female, on the other hand, is completely green. Their beaks are small, even in relation to their body size.  The African Lovebirds as the name suggests, originated from Madagascar and Africa. They caught man's attention in the middle of the nineteenth century and have since been captivated by man in both his imagination and reality.  --source www.parrotsecrets.com-  --captured by: xergs--"

Anton blessed us by sharing his life of over three years, which is a nice , long life for a rattie.   He has gradually slowed down over the last few months, and was weak and listless last week- I knew his time left was very short. I spent lots of time with him sitting on my lap, wrapped in a blanket, with me scratching between his ears. He was weak, but he was  bruxing. (gentle grinding of the teeth- usually a sign of relaxation and contentment) Last night I went in to give him his dinner and some cuddle time, and he was gone.  He was such a good friend. He would come when you called him, loved to steal any kind of important papers, adored english peas, and enjoying chewing holes in some of my sweatshirts- turning them into one of a kind designer clothing. He was a very, very special creature and brought such delight and joy to myself and my daughter. I got this pic last week when he was not well- I suspected it might be my last pic. It is a very sad time now at my house.  He will be missed terribly. Shanti, shanti, shanti  sweet Anton."

For am I not here, I, your Mother? Are you not in the cool of my shadow? In the breeziness of my shade?  Is it not I that am your source of contentment? Are you not cradled in my mantle? cuddled in the crossing of my arms? Is there anything else for you to need?""  Our Lady of Guadalupe  ~  ""Feminine energy is powerful because it is pure presence -- gentle yet firm.  It is an energy that gives warmth, comfort, and spirit simply by its presence.  It receives rather than takes.  It invites rather than demands.  It unfolds rather than controls.  It empowers rather than overpowers.  It finds itself in being rather than in doing.  Feminine energy shows her best face in leisure.  She doesn't take time.  She has time.  She has time to be.  The world is starving for this energy.  It is part of the fire Christ came to cast on the earth - a slow ame that burns from within and gradually transforms what it touches, precisely because it touches rather than clutches.  MACRINA WIEDERKEHR, A Tree Full of Angels, Seeing the Holy in the Ordinary, Harper Collins Publishers  ~  I found this church/shrine a comforting place to be while I was in Santa Fe this summer.  A much smaller place than the St. Francis cathedral in the downtown, and less visited, but this place felt instantly homelike. The priest gave an inspiring talk about how the face of God looks different depending on your culture/background. It kind of felt like being in Divine Mother's womb, a good place to be as I prayed for my brother who was struggling with pancreatic cancer."

It is Latin meaning ""I Become All Things"". Society keeps bombarding us on how we should always strive for happiness at all times.  It's total bullshit IMHO.  I've learned that trying to be happy all the time is like constantly flexing a muscle.  At some point you'll damage yourself or the moment you stop being happy the smallest sense of misery will be overwhelming.    I've decided to adopt a bit of Eastern philosophy.  To strive for inner peace and contentment.  To let the chaos flow around me and not flow with the chaos or to fight it back.  A stone in a river letting the waves pass over me, not to be the leaf being tossed around nor the dam trying to hold the river back.   To redirect the energy.   Emotional Aikido.

Gee is her name, and she greeted us with a phrase in German, which I didn't quite get, but which meant something like ""life is beautiful"". Her exclamation was expressing, I guess, the contentment of having arrived in the resort of Ascona, Switzerland, situated in  the northernmost part of the Lago Maggiore. The place  is indeed a wonderful place (see comment photo), and we stopped to chat with her for a while.  Gee had just arrived from Basel, where she resides, and, after checking in, had moved herself onto the sea-front for a drink and taking in the view. I asked her about her country, and she was more than willing to impart her views and opinions of the Swizz  people.  When I asked her to get a stranger shot, she seemed to take it as a compliment - which it was - but also had doubts if she would still be an attractive subject: she had modelled in previous times she said. I took one or two, and she looked terrified in the shots, so I had to chat-and-shoot, and when I finally got her laughing I caught this.  Well, Gee, thanks for the photo; I cannot imagine that you ever looked better in your life!  This picture is #59 in my 100 strangers project.

Even after the establishment of the Ming dynasty in 1368 Ni continued the life of a wanderer, visiting old haunts and he had not seen for twenty or thirty years. According to his epitaph writer, Zhou Nanlao (1308-1383), in his late years, he became quieter and more withdrawn than ever. Having lost or given away everything he ever owned, he did his best to forget his worries .Wearing a yellow [Daoist] cap and country clothes, he roamed the lakes and mountains, leading a recluses life.  Woods and Valleys of Mount Yu, executed two years before Ni Zans death, express the painters contentment in the life of a recluse. The poem ends with the lines: We watch the clouds and daub with our brushes We drink wine and write poems, The joyous feelings of this day Will linger long after we have parted.  The dry but tender brushwork is aloof and restrained. There is a tranquil luminous quality about the painting that makes it one of the most fully realized works of the artists later years.

The Afro American community (outside the usual vociferous gang of self-rightious, hypocritical thugs) has a long history showing an acceptance of many ""male"" same-sex couples.   Yet the media will focus on those men who had the misfortune of living in homophobic circles for some length of time and portray their word as the literal gospel on the black view of same-sex living.

Today, I watched the video for Lego House, which may be the most interesting music video I've ever watched.  Just for people who haven't seen the video, it includes the amazing Rupert Grint as a mega-fan of Ed Sheeran, who sings Lego House. This mega-fan really is a mega-fan- he has posters and books about Ed and knows all the lyrics to Ed's songs and has a guitar signed by him and has a doll with Ed's face on it that he talks too. The mega-fan goes through an emotional battle over his love for Ed Sheeran- he's seems quite happy with his love for Ed at first, but then he starts to see how lonely he is, and it seems as if he blames Ed Sheeran, who he has never left. His journey leads him to the stage of Ed's concert, where he gets kicked off, and when he is being escorted out, he gets one glimpse of Ed Sheeran, and immediately, his emotions change to exactly what they were at the beginning of the video- contentment.  At first, I thought that maybe the mega-fan was supposed to have something mentally wrong with him, because no one really does the crazy things he did.  But then, I realized that I do.  I realized that everyone does. At least everyone who is lonely. At least everyone who loves someone who doesn't know they exist.  Love and loneliness lead people to the most unusual places. When you are so lonely that you would pretend to love someone who is fictional in your world, you are the boy talking to inanimate objects. When you love someone so much that you would travel a million miles just to see them for a day, you are the kid who gets happy while being lead out by security guards. You are the equivalent to a mindless child or a man who doesn't live in the same world as everyone else. You are lost. You fight an emotional battle. You build your own lego house.   And when you see that person you love or find a cure to that loneliness for even a second, you are happy.   "

I remembered seeing what looked like an old, abandoned barn and silo and had noted some parking across the street. I went there tonight and when I first walked over, although the grass in front (close to the road) was mowed, as I walked farther back to the barn, it was way overgrown with vegetation. I walked around and found what once was a basement of a house that apparently had burned. At first I thought I'd have to make a jump for it, but quickly found these steps. They were still covered in glass that I had to kick out of the way.  I wished I had been able to go to the NATO protests today and tonight, but unfortunately I had to work. But I'm planning on going tomorrow and maybe Sunday.  139/366   "

I really liked the 2013 LUTS summer gift head, and Mirodoll was having a sale so the 68cm body was beyond cheap just as I was whining about how I didn't have a character for the Ehead and I needed my antagonist back in doll form the stars aligned.  (And Sephy hit me upside the head with the obvious solution, haha.)  He is both a total hottie and my cheapest doll to date, and this tickles me endlessly.  XD    I think he looks kinda like a Latidoll.  What the what, LUTS?  Also this body is pretty but I'm still working on restringing it to not be a pain in the butt.  Resin match is A+.  Wig is from Leeke, cut by me.  I am dolly hairstylist to the stars!    To those of you playing the home game, Marcus is the man who murdered Mitchell.  He was also Mitchell's best friend who was in love with him and, realizing that was never going to happen, decided to look for contentment elsewhere in an arranged marriage with Ro.  He lost his mind when he realized they'd fallen for each other and were about to leave him together, beat an unsuspecting Mitchell to death, and then spent the next two centuries following them through reincarnation cycles trying to assuage his own guilt whenever he could by trying to fit the pieces of their lives back together the way he wanted them.  His patience never lasts, and he can't seem to stop himself from hurting them even though it leaves him mad with grief afterwards.  He keeps their corpses from one life when he got particularly close to the happy threesome he wanted before Ro ruined it in his parlor.    He's a ravening psycho, okay?   (But he's not supposed to look like one, so this mold is actually perfect.  Like he doesn't know WHAT you've heard about him, but you must be MISINFORMED, you silly goose, haha! *stab*) "

Just a simple day of good weather, driving with the windows down - a little music blasting but needing to go somewhere, seeking to discover more of the new chapter of my life. Just to feel nature around me and the world going places makes me feel better about being so idle lately but I know I'm going somewhere, I've just been so unsure but so sure. I don't know if it makes sense if I go or stay anymore to some. But to all, it's complicated or at least for me it is.   I'm in the middle of two things, the closing of life after high school and the new world after. Here I swing trying to find where I shall go next. I'm still trying to figure out everything but sometimes I just wish I could live life on the strings of spontaneous. "

Just as I raised my camera she smiled to herself. Your guess is as good as mine what she was thinking!  There was a large area of shade directly behind her which led to the strong contrast. I just tweaked it (darkened the shadows and cropped slightly) in Lightroom.

contentment,http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4092/5060038719_d5efd012c5_z.jpg,2,3,"5 Colour Weave Wheel This sculpture is very significant to me in quite a number of different ways.  I suppose it represents the perpetual turning of the wheel but this time it has clicked into a new gear. New materials, new techniques, new horizons. Something less ephemeral, that has taken longer to create and yet still made only from materials gathered from hedgerows nearby. All natural colours, no dyeing or anything else required.  Land art has opened me up and turned me inside out and revealed my soul. It has shown me there may be a different way to exist, provided clarity through the fog and given me a whole new purpose. A purpose that now seems deep set within me and crucially it is now coupled with the drive and self confidence to make something happen. This was always missing from my life before.   I am amazed and also saddened by the amount of people I talk to who feel they are trapped in the hamster wheel of working life. Each one of them dreaming of a statistically very unlikely lottery win or a key that will unlock the padlock that chains them to their desk and a life of boredom and drudgery.  I used to spend my life like many others do trying to portray to the world  something I was not. I bought gadgets and expensive things to create an aura around myself of success and wealth and yet I was neither successful nor wealthy, monetarily or within my soul.  I know now that all I was trying to do was fill the hole inside of me but instead all I did was draw a curtain across it. And I now see this going on all around me.  Some people I know in particular are very much stuck running around this wheel. A wheel that gradually screws itself into the ground as their ostentatiousness that is needed to cover their path has to grow and grow and grow. New car? Check. New big house? Check. Personalised number plates? Check. The constant need to tell everyone how successful and happy you are? Check. The never ending urge to be better than everyone around you? Check. Real contentment and happiness inside? That check bounces.  If you feel the need to constantly tell people that you are very successful and happy then you are really missing the point. If there is a hole in the bottom of your boat that is letting in water then spending your cash on a bigger and bigger ladle to bail out the water until it is solid gold and diamond encrusted means you haven't noticed that your boat is still sinking. If you spend long enough telling all your friends that you are better, happier and more successful than them then eventually you won't have any friends to tell any more. One day you'll need to realise that you need to fix the boat and stop bailing. A brand new GPS boat navigation system isn't going to do that even if your boating neighbours are still using a compass and a sextant.  The last few years due to unforeseen circumstances I've had to live a more frugal life. What at first seemed like something to endure turned into a blessing in disguise. During this time I learned to make land art sculptures. I tried to get the best out of my camera when before, in order  to improve the quality of results I would have spent excessive money on bigger and more expensive equipment whilst never getting to grips with what I already had. And as I emerge from this period and once again I could spend money on pointless gadgets I find I am not tempted. In fact I want to down size and have less, want to want less and strive to have less.  Land art is free. Free of constraints of the modern world and nature provides her materials for free. Walking, wondering and exploring are free and freeing. There isn't much else that I need.  I had a lucid dream last night. It was my first spontaneous one. A few years ago I trained myself to have them and after a lot of effort I had a few, so it was very interesting to have another one without any volition.  When I realised I was dreaming in my dream the intensity of everything increased ten fold. I tried to make the sun rise and it did and then I had another go at flying. Normally when I have tried this before I kind of float four foot above the ground Superman style, but can only manage a walking pace glide. I will myself to go faster and climb into the sky but it doesn't happen, it's like I am only powered by wound up elastic band and not a Rolls Royce engine.  The after affects of a lucid dream are a feeling of elation carried into the waking day. To go with this the sky was blue and bright and the golden autumn sunshine made my soul soar up into the clouds that I couldn't quite reach in my dream.  Whether my feeling of optimism for the future is due to the weather and the intensity of the dream doesn't matter to me. As I sit here typing these words I feel the clock has turned one more notch into a new phase of my life. A future with many more days feeling free amongst nature, the sun shining and the sky blue.   And then perhaps one day I can release myself from that low level hover and at last fly up into the sky.  Oh and hello to the art teacher I met out at Birk Bank this evening. It was nice to chat and I hope one day I do as well as your electrician mate!   "

TASAWWUF ""There is no doubt that Tasawwuf is an important branch of Islam. The word itself may have been derived form the Arabic word ""Soof"" (Wool) or from ""Safa"" (cleanliness), but its foundation lies in ones personal sincerity in seeking Allahs nearness and trying to live a life pleasing to Him. Study of the Quran, the Hadith, and the practical life of the holy Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) and his faithful Companions provide unmistakable support to this reality."" (Hazrat Moulana Allah Yar Khan (R.A)  SUFISM, AN ESSENTIAL PART OF ISLAM Doubts exist not only in the minds of the Muslim faithful but also among the Ulema, notably the exoteric about Tasawwuf and its votaries. Often they lead to misunderstanding, as if Shariah and Tariqah were two separate entries, or that Tasawwuf was some obscure discipline foreign to Islam, or that it was altogether above the established laws and injunctions of our Religion. To help remove these misgivings and to reassure seekers, as well as scholars, our Sheikh Hazrat Moulana Allah Yar Khan (R.A), Sheikh Silsila Naqshbandia Awaisia, wrote Al-Jamal Wal Kamal, Aqaid-O-Kamalaat Ulmai-e-Deoband, Binat-e-Rasool (S.A.W), Daamad-e-Ali (R.A), Dalael-us-Salook, Ejaad-e-Mazhab Shia, Hayat-un-Nabi (S.A.W), Hayat Barzakhia, Ilm-o-Irfan, Niffaz-e-Shariat Aur Fiqah-e-Jaferia, Saif-e-Owaisi, Shikast-e-Ahdai Hussain and Tahkeek Halal Haram books.  BIOGRAPHY Sheikh Allah Yar Khan was born in Chakrala, a remote village of Mianwali District of Pakistan, in 1904. He completed his religious education in 1934. The very year, he met Shaykh Abdul Rahim, who took him to the shrine of Shaykh Allah Deen Madni. By Divine Will his spiritual connection was right away established with the saint of the 10th century Hijra (sixteenth century) and he started receiving spiritual beneficence. His sublime education in Sufism, signifying progressive spiritual growth and advancement, continued for about twenty-five years. In 1962 he was directed to carry out the propagation of Prophetic blessings - a noble mission that he accomplished with singular enthusiasm and devotion for a period spanning half a century. Anybody who visited him was duly rewarded with a share of spiritual bliss as per his/her sincerity and capacity. Shaykh Allah Yar Khan's mission produced men and women of deep spiritual vision and distinction.  Although Hazrat Moulana Allah Yar Khan (R.A) have lived a major portion of his life as a scholar, with the avowed mission of illuminating the truth of Islam and the negation of fallacious sects, and this would appear quite removed from Tasawwuf, yet the only practical difference between the two, namely the use of the former as a media to expound the truth, and the latter to imbue people with positive faith. Nevertheless, people are amazed that a man, who until the other day, was known as a dialectician and a preacher of Islam, is not only talking of Mystic Path, but is also claiming spiritual bonds with the veteran Sufi Masters of the Past. This amazement is obviously out of place in the view of Quranic injunction: This is the bounty of Allah which He gives to whom He wills. (62:4)  THE PURIFICATION OF THE SOUL The purification of the soul always formed part of the main mission of the Prophets; that is, the dissemination and propagation of the Devine Message. This responsibility later fell directly on the shoulders of the true Ulema in the Ummah of the last Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W), who, as his genuine successors, have continued to shed brave light in every Dark Age of materialism and sacrilege. In the present age of ruinous confusion, the importance of this responsibility has increased manifold; of the utter neglect of Islam by Muslims has not only driven them to misery, but also grievously weakened their bonds of faith in Allah and His Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W). The decay in their belief and consequent perversion in their conduct has reached a stage that any attempt to pull them out of the depth of ignominy and the heedless chaos of faithlessness, attracts grave uncertainties and apprehensions rather than a encouraging will to follow the Shariah, to purify the soul and to reform within. The Quranic Verse: Layers upon layers of darkness (24:40) provides the nearest expression of their present state.  SHARIAH & SUFISM Any action against the Sunnah (Prophets way of life) cannot be called Sufism. Singing and dancing, and the prostration on tombs are not part of Sufism. Nor is predicting the future and predicting the outcome of cases in the courts of law, a part of Sufism. Sufis are not required to abandon their worldly possessions or live in the wilderness far from the practical world. In fact these absurdities are just its opposites. It is an established fact that Tazkiyah (soul purification) stands for that inner purity which inspires a persons spirit to obey the holy Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W). If a false claimant of Sufism teaches tricks and jugglery, ignoring religious obligations, he is an impostor. A true Sheikh will lead a believer to the august spiritual audience of the holy Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W). If you are fortunate enough to be blessed with the company of an accomplished spiritual guide and Sheikh of Sufism, and if you follow his instructions, you will observe a positive change in yourself, transferring you from vice to virtue.  ISLAM, AS A COMPLETE CODE OF LIFE Islam, as a complete code of life or Deen, was perfected during the life of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W). He was the sole teacher and his mosque was the core institution for the community. Although Islam in its entirety was practiced during that blessed era, the classification and compilation of its knowledge into distinct branches like Tafsir (interpretation of the Quran), Hadith (traditions or sayings of the holy Prophet- SAWS), Fiqh (Islamic law), and Sufism (the soul purification) were undertaken subsequently. This Deen of Allah passed from the holy Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) to his illustrious Companions in two ways: the outward and the inward. The former comprised the knowledge defined by speech and conduct, i.e., the Quran and Sunnah. The latter comprised the invisible blessings or the Prophetic lights transmitted by his blessed self. These blessings purified the hearts and instilled in them a passionate desire to follow Islam with utmost love, honesty and loyalty.  WHATS SUFISM Sufism is the attempt to attain these Barakah (Blessings). The Companions handed down Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) teachings as well as blessings to the Tabaeen. Their strong hearts were capable of infusing these blessings into the hearts of their followers. Both aspects of Islam were similarly passed on by the Tabaeen to the Taba Tabaeen. The compilation of knowledge and its interpretation led to the establishment of many schools of religious thought; famous four being the Hanafi, the Hanbali, the Maliki, and the Shafa'i, all named after their founders. Similarly, in order to acquire, safeguard and distribute his blessings, an organized effort was initiated by four schools of Sufism: The Naqshbandia, the Qadria, the Chishtia, and the Suharwardia. These schools were also named after their organizers and came to be known as Sufi Orders. All these Orders intend to purify the hearts of sincere Muslims with Prophetic lights. These Sufi Orders also grew into many branches with the passage of time and are known by other names as well. The holy Quran has linked success in this life and the Hereafter with Tazkiyah (soul purification). He, who purified, is successful. (87: 14) Sufi Orders of Islam are the institutions where the basics of Tazkiyah (soul purification) and its practical application are taught. They have graded programs in which every new seeker is instructed in Zikr-e Lisani (oral Zikr) and is finally taught the Zikr-e Qalbi (Remembrance in heart).  ZIKR-E QALBI However, in the Naqshbandia Order, Zikr-e Qalbi is practiced from the very beginning. Adherence to the Sunnah (Prophets way of life) is greatly emphasized in this Order, because the seeker achieves greater and quicker progress through its blessings. The essence of Zikr is that the Qalb should sincerely accept Islamic beliefs and gain the strength to follow the Sunnah with even greater devotion. If the heart is acquainted with Allah and is engaged in His Zikr; then it is filled with Barakaat-e Nabuwwat (Prophetic blessings) which infuse their purity in the mind and body. This not only helps in controlling sensual drives but also removes traces of abhorrence, voracity, envy and insecurity from human soul. The person therefore becomes an embodiment of love, both for the Divine and the corporeal. This is the meaning of a Hadith, There is a lump of flesh in the human body; if it goes astray the entire body is misguided, and if it is reformed the entire body is reformed. Know that this lump is the Qalb.  PAS ANFAS Recent History Khawajah Naqshband (d. 1389 CE) organized the Naqshbandia Order at Bukhara (Central Asia). This Order has two main branches  the Mujaddidia and the Owaisiah. The former is identified with Sheikh Ahmed Sirhindi, known as Mujaddid Alif Sani (literally: reviver of the second Muslim millennium), a successor to Khawajah Baqi Billah, who introduced the Order to the Indo- Pakistan sub-continent. The Owaisiah Order employs a similar method of Zikr but acquires the Prophetic blessings in the manner of Khawajah Owais Qarni, who received this beneficence from the Holy Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) without a formal physical meeting. The Zikr employed by the Naqshbandia is Zikr-e Khafi Qalbi (remembrance of Allahs Name within the heart) and the method is termed Pas Anfas, which (in Persian) means guarding every breath. The Chain of Transmission of these Barakah, of course, emanates from the holy Prophet- SAWS.  SPIRITUAL BAIAT (OATH OF ALLEGIANCE It is necessary in all Sufi Orders that the Sheikh and the seekers must be contemporaries and must physically meet each other for the transfer of these blessings. However, the Naqshbandia Owaisiah Order goes beyond this requirement and Sufis of this Order receive these Barakah regardless of physical meeting with their Sheikh or even when the Sheikh is not their contemporary. Yet, it must be underscored that physical meeting with the Sheikh of this Order still holds great importance in dissemination of these Barakah. Sheikh Sirhindi writes about the Owaisiah Order in his book Tazkirah: It is the most sublime, the most exalted, and the most effectiveand the highest station of all others is only its stepping stone. By far the greatest singular distinction of the Naqshbandia Owaisiah Order is the honor of Spiritual Baiat (Oath of Allegiance) directly at the blessed hands of the holy Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W).  SHEIKH HAZRAT MOULANA ALLAH YAR KHAN (R.A) The Reviver Sheikh Allah Yar Khan was born in Chikrala, a remote village of Mianwali District of Pakistan, in 1904. He completed his religious education in 1934. The same year, he met Sheikh Abdul Rahim, who took him to the shrine of Sheikh Allah Deen Madni. By Divine Will his spiritual connection was immediately established with the saint of the 10th century Hijra (sixteenth century CE) and he started receiving spiritual beneficence. His sublime education in Sufism, signifying progressive spiritual growth and advancement, continued for about twenty-five years, after which he was directed to undertake the propagation of Prophetic blessings - a noble mission that he accomplished with singular zeal and dedication for a period spanning half a century. Anybody who visited him was duly rewarded with a share of spiritual bliss commensurate with his/her sincerity and capacity. Sheikh Allah Yar Khans mission produced men and women of deep spiritual vision and eminence. He authored eighteen books, the most distinguished being Dalael us-Sulook (Sufism - An Objective Appraisal), Hayat-e Barzakhiah (Life Beyond Life) and Israr ul- Haramain (Secrets of the two holy Mosques). He was undoubtedly one of the most distinguished Sufi saints of the Muslim Ummah and a reviver of the Naqshbandia Owaisiah Order. He passed away on 18 February 1984 in Islamabad at the age of eighty.  THE CHAIN OF TRANSMISSION OF NAQSHBANDIA OWAISIAH 1. Hazrat Muhammad ur-Rasool Allah (Sall Allah-o Alaihi wa Sallam), 2. Hazrat Abu Bakr Siddiq (Radhi Allah-o Unho), 3. Hazrat Imam Hassan Basri (Rahmat Ullah Alaihi), 4. Hazrat Daud Tai (Rahmat Ullah Alaihi), 5. Hazrat Junaid Baghdadi (Rahmat Ullah Alaihi), 6. Hazrat Ubaid Ullah Ahrar (Rahmat Ullah Alaihi), 7. Hazrat Abdur Rahman Jami (Rahmat Ullah Alaihi), 8. Hazrat Abu Ayub Muhammad Salih (Rahmat Ullah Alaihi), 9. Hazrat Allah Deen Madni (Rahmat Ullah Alaihi), 10. Hazrat Moulana Allah Yar Khan (Rahmat Ullah Alaihi).  THE SPIRIT OR RUH The spirit or Ruh of every person is a created reflection of the Divine Attributes and it originates in Alam-e Amar (Realm of Command). Its food is the Light of Allah or the Divine Refulgence, which it acquires from the Realm of Command through the holy Prophet Muhammad (may Allahs choicest favors and peace be upon him), whose status in the spiritual world is like that of the sun in the solar system. The Quran refers to him as the bright lamp. Indeed, he is the divinely selected channel of all Barakah. All Exalted Messengers themselves receive these Barakah from him.  LATAIF The human Ruh also possesses vital organs like the physical body; through which it acquires its knowledge, food and energy. These are called Lataif (singular Latifah: subtlety). Scholars of various Sufi Orders have associated them with specific areas of the human body. The Naqshbandia Owaisiah Order identifies these Lataif as follows. First - Qalb: This spiritual faculty is located within the physical heart. Its function is Zikr. Its strength increases ones capacity for Allahs Zikr. Second  Ruh: The site of this Latifah, which is a distinct faculty of the human Ruh, is on the right side of the chest at the level of Qalb. Its primary function is concentration towards Allah. Third  Sirri: This is located above the Qalb and functions to make possible Kashf. Forth  Khaffi: This is located above the Ruh and functions to perceive the omnipresence of Allah. Fifth  Akhfa: This is located in the middle of chest, at the centre of the first four Lataif and makes it possible for the Ruh to perceive the closeness of Allah, Who is closer to us than our own selves. Sixth  Nafs: This Latifah is located at the forehead and functions to purify the human soul. Seventh  Sultan al-Azkar: This Latifah is located at the top centre of the head and serves to absorb the Barakah of Allah into the entire body, so that every cell resonates with Zikr.  FIVE EXALTED MESSENGERS OF GOD There are Five Exalted Messengers among the many known and unknown Messengers of Allah. They are Hazrat Muhammad, Hazrat Nuh (Noah), Hazrat Ibrahim (Abraham), Hazrat Musa (Moses), and Hazrat Esa (Jesus), peace be upon them all. Hazrat Adam is the first Prophet of Allah and the father of mankind. Each Latifah is associated with a particular Prophet. The Barakah and lights from Hazrat Adam (peace be upon him), descend on the first Latifah Qalb; its lights are reflected from the first heaven and are yellowish. The second Latifah is associated with Hazrat Nuh and Hazrat Ibrahim (peace be upon them). Its lights descend from the second heaven and appear as golden red. The lights descending upon the third Latifah are from Hazrat Musa (peace be upon him) and are white. One the fourth Latifah, the lights of Hazrat Esa (peace be upon him) descend from the fourth heaven and are deep blue. The fifth Latifah receives its Barakah directly from the holy Prophet Muhammad (may Allahs choicest favors and peace be upon him). The lights associated with this Latifah are green, descend from the fifth heaven, and overwhelm all the first four Lataif. The Lights descending upon the sixth and seventh Lataif are the Divine Lights, whose color and condition cannot be determined. These are like flashes of lightening that defy comprehension. If Allah blesses a seeker with Kashf, he can observe all of this. The vision is slightly diffused in the beginning, but gradually the clarity improves.  SULOOK Stages of the Path After all seven Lataif of a seeker have been illuminated with Divine Lights through Tawajjuh of the Sheikh and his Ruh has acquired the ability to fly, the Sheikh initiates its journey on the sublime Path of Divine nearness. The Path is known as Sulook, and its stages are not hypothetical imaginations but real and actually existing stations on the spiritual Path. These are also referred to as Meditations, because a seeker mentally meditates about a station while his/her Ruh actually ascends towards it. The first three stations that form the base of whole Sulook are described as; Ahadiyyat, a station of Absolute Unity of Divinity. It is above and beyond the seven heavens. It is so vast a station that the seven heavens and all that they encompass are lost within Ahadiyyat as a ring is lost in a vast desert. Its lights are white in color. Maiyyat station denotes Divine Company, He is with you, wherever you might be. This station is so vast that Ahadiyyat along with the seven heavens beneath are lost within it as a ring is lost in a desert. Its lights are green in color. Aqrabiyyat station denotes Divine Nearness, He is nearer to you than your life- vein. Again, Aqrabiyyat is vast as compared to Maiyyat in the same proportion. Its lights are golden red and are reflected from the Divine Throne. It is indeed the greatest favor of Almighty Allah that He blesses a seeker with an accomplished Sheikh, who takes him to these sublime stations. The final station that a seeker attains to during his/her lifetime becomes his/her Iliyyeen (blessed abode) in Barzakh and his/her Ruh stays at this station after death.   ZIKR Why is Zikr Necessary for Everyone? Allah ordains every soul in the Quran to Perform Zikr. This not only means reciting the Quran and Tasbeeh but also Zikr-e Qalb. It is only through Zikr-e Qalbi that Prophetic Lights reach the depths of human soul and purify it from all vice and evil. Zikr infuses a realization of constant Divine Presence and a seeker feels great improvement in the level of sincerity and love towards Allah and the holy Prophet- SAWS. Such levels of sincerity, love and feelings of Divine Presence can never be obtained without Zikr. It would be a mistake to believe that Zikr may be a requirement only for the very pious and virtuous people. Zikr provides the Prophetic blessings which are in effect the life line of every human soul. It transforms even the most corrupted humans into virtuous souls by bringing out the best in them. The fact is that Zikr is the only way to achieve true contentment and satisfaction in life. The holy Quran has pointed to this eternal fact that it is only through Zikr Allah that hearts can find satisfaction. Such satisfaction and peace are the ultimate requirements of every person, regardless of religion, race and ethnicity. Practicing Zikr regularly removes all traces of anxiety and restlessness, and guides the human soul to eternal bliss and peace.  KHALIFA MAJAZEEN Hazrat Moulana Allah Yar Khan (R.A), during his life time in 1974, presented a nomination list to Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W), during Maraqba, of expected Khalifa Majazeen for Silsila Naqshbandia Awaisia. Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) approved some names, deleted some of the names, and added down the name of Major Ghulam Muhammad as also Khalifa Majaaz of Silsila Naqshbandia Awaisia (which was not previously included in the list)  The approved names at that time included:  1. Mr. Muhammad Akram Awan Sahib,  2. Mr. Sayed Bunyad Hussain Shah Sahib,  3. Mr. Major Ahsan Baig Sahib,  4. Mr. Col. Matloob Hussain Sahib,  5. Mr. Major Ghulam Muhammad Sahib of Wan Bhachran Mianwali,  6. Mr. Molvi Abdul Haq Sahib,  7. Mr. Hafiz Abdul Razzaq Sahib,  8. Mr. Hafiz Ghulam Qadri Sahib,  9. Mr. Khan Muhammad Irani Sahib,  10. Mr. Maolana Abdul Ghafoor Sahib,  11. Mr. Syed Muhammad Hassan Sahib of Zohb.  These Majazeen were authorized to; held Majalis of Zikar (Pas Anfas) in their respective areas, arrange Majalis of Zikar in neighboring areas, train them on the way of Sulook, prepare them for Spiritual Baiat (Oath of Allegiance), and present them to Sheikh Hazrat Moulana Allah Yar Khan for Spiritual Baiat at the Hand of Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W), in the life of Hazrat Moulana Allah Yar Khan (R.A), and were all equal in status as Khalifa Majaaz of Hazrat Moulana Allah Yar Khan (R.A).  Presently we are following Hazrat Major  Ghulam Muhammad Sahib, Khalifa Majaaz of Hazrat Moulana Allah Yar Khan (R.A). "

It was a steady uphill hike that seemed to last forever (but probably just because I was far too excited just to get to the falls).   After running around the falls with my tripod and taking pictures from like 10 different spots, I crossed over the water and sat right here in utter contentment (though unfortunately bound by time constraints). I literally could have spent the entire day here taking pictures or reading or writing, or staring at the amazingness all around me.

A variety of biological, psychological, religious, and philosophical approaches have striven to define happiness and identify its sources. Various research groups, including positive psychology, endeavor to apply the scientific method to answer questions about what ""happiness"" is, and how it might be attained. It is of such fundamental importance to the human condition that ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"" were deemed to be unalienable rights by the United States Declaration of Independence.  Philosophers and religious thinkers often define happiness in terms of living a good life, or flourishing, rather than simply as an emotion. Happiness in this sense was used to translate the Greek Eudaimonia, and is still used in virtue ethics. Happiness economics suggests that measures of public happiness should be used to supplement more traditional economic measures when evaluating the success of public policy.  Wikipedia"

TASAWWUF ""There is no doubt that Tasawwuf is an important branch of Islam. The word itself may have been derived form the Arabic word ""Soof"" (Wool) or from ""Safa"" (cleanliness), but its foundation lies in ones personal sincerity in seeking Allahs nearness and trying to live a life pleasing to Him. Study of the Quran, the Hadith, and the practical life of the holy Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) and his faithful Companions provide unmistakable support to this reality."" (Hazrat Moulana Allah Yar Khan (R.A)  SUFISM, AN ESSENTIAL PART OF ISLAM Doubts exist not only in the minds of the Muslim faithful but also among the Ulema, notably the exoteric about Tasawwuf and its votaries. Often they lead to misunderstanding, as if Shariah and Tariqah were two separate entries, or that Tasawwuf was some obscure discipline foreign to Islam, or that it was altogether above the established laws and injunctions of our Religion. To help remove these misgivings and to reassure seekers, as well as scholars, our Sheikh Hazrat Moulana Allah Yar Khan (R.A), Sheikh Silsila Naqshbandia Awaisia, wrote Al-Jamal Wal Kamal, Aqaid-O-Kamalaat Ulmai-e-Deoband, Binat-e-Rasool (S.A.W), Daamad-e-Ali (R.A), Dalael-us-Salook, Ejaad-e-Mazhab Shia, Hayat-un-Nabi (S.A.W), Hayat Barzakhia, Ilm-o-Irfan, Niffaz-e-Shariat Aur Fiqah-e-Jaferia, Saif-e-Owaisi, Shikast-e-Ahdai Hussain and Tahkeek Halal Haram books.  BIOGRAPHY Sheikh Allah Yar Khan was born in Chakrala, a remote village of Mianwali District of Pakistan, in 1904. He completed his religious education in 1934. The very year, he met Shaykh Abdul Rahim, who took him to the shrine of Shaykh Allah Deen Madni. By Divine Will his spiritual connection was right away established with the saint of the 10th century Hijra (sixteenth century) and he started receiving spiritual beneficence. His sublime education in Sufism, signifying progressive spiritual growth and advancement, continued for about twenty-five years. In 1962 he was directed to carry out the propagation of Prophetic blessings - a noble mission that he accomplished with singular enthusiasm and devotion for a period spanning half a century. Anybody who visited him was duly rewarded with a share of spiritual bliss as per his/her sincerity and capacity. Shaykh Allah Yar Khan's mission produced men and women of deep spiritual vision and distinction.  Although Hazrat Moulana Allah Yar Khan (R.A) have lived a major portion of his life as a scholar, with the avowed mission of illuminating the truth of Islam and the negation of fallacious sects, and this would appear quite removed from Tasawwuf, yet the only practical difference between the two, namely the use of the former as a media to expound the truth, and the latter to imbue people with positive faith. Nevertheless, people are amazed that a man, who until the other day, was known as a dialectician and a preacher of Islam, is not only talking of Mystic Path, but is also claiming spiritual bonds with the veteran Sufi Masters of the Past. This amazement is obviously out of place in the view of Quranic injunction: This is the bounty of Allah which He gives to whom He wills. (62:4)  THE PURIFICATION OF THE SOUL The purification of the soul always formed part of the main mission of the Prophets; that is, the dissemination and propagation of the Devine Message. This responsibility later fell directly on the shoulders of the true Ulema in the Ummah of the last Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W), who, as his genuine successors, have continued to shed brave light in every Dark Age of materialism and sacrilege. In the present age of ruinous confusion, the importance of this responsibility has increased manifold; of the utter neglect of Islam by Muslims has not only driven them to misery, but also grievously weakened their bonds of faith in Allah and His Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W). The decay in their belief and consequent perversion in their conduct has reached a stage that any attempt to pull them out of the depth of ignominy and the heedless chaos of faithlessness, attracts grave uncertainties and apprehensions rather than a encouraging will to follow the Shariah, to purify the soul and to reform within. The Quranic Verse: Layers upon layers of darkness (24:40) provides the nearest expression of their present state.  SHARIAH & SUFISM Any action against the Sunnah (Prophets way of life) cannot be called Sufism. Singing and dancing, and the prostration on tombs are not part of Sufism. Nor is predicting the future and predicting the outcome of cases in the courts of law, a part of Sufism. Sufis are not required to abandon their worldly possessions or live in the wilderness far from the practical world. In fact these absurdities are just its opposites. It is an established fact that Tazkiyah (soul purification) stands for that inner purity which inspires a persons spirit to obey the holy Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W). If a false claimant of Sufism teaches tricks and jugglery, ignoring religious obligations, he is an impostor. A true Sheikh will lead a believer to the august spiritual audience of the holy Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W). If you are fortunate enough to be blessed with the company of an accomplished spiritual guide and Sheikh of Sufism, and if you follow his instructions, you will observe a positive change in yourself, transferring you from vice to virtue.  ISLAM, AS A COMPLETE CODE OF LIFE Islam, as a complete code of life or Deen, was perfected during the life of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W). He was the sole teacher and his mosque was the core institution for the community. Although Islam in its entirety was practiced during that blessed era, the classification and compilation of its knowledge into distinct branches like Tafsir (interpretation of the Quran), Hadith (traditions or sayings of the holy Prophet- SAWS), Fiqh (Islamic law), and Sufism (the soul purification) were undertaken subsequently. This Deen of Allah passed from the holy Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) to his illustrious Companions in two ways: the outward and the inward. The former comprised the knowledge defined by speech and conduct, i.e., the Quran and Sunnah. The latter comprised the invisible blessings or the Prophetic lights transmitted by his blessed self. These blessings purified the hearts and instilled in them a passionate desire to follow Islam with utmost love, honesty and loyalty.  WHATS SUFISM Sufism is the attempt to attain these Barakah (Blessings). The Companions handed down Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) teachings as well as blessings to the Tabaeen. Their strong hearts were capable of infusing these blessings into the hearts of their followers. Both aspects of Islam were similarly passed on by the Tabaeen to the Taba Tabaeen. The compilation of knowledge and its interpretation led to the establishment of many schools of religious thought; famous four being the Hanafi, the Hanbali, the Maliki, and the Shafa'i, all named after their founders. Similarly, in order to acquire, safeguard and distribute his blessings, an organized effort was initiated by four schools of Sufism: The Naqshbandia, the Qadria, the Chishtia, and the Suharwardia. These schools were also named after their organizers and came to be known as Sufi Orders. All these Orders intend to purify the hearts of sincere Muslims with Prophetic lights. These Sufi Orders also grew into many branches with the passage of time and are known by other names as well. The holy Quran has linked success in this life and the Hereafter with Tazkiyah (soul purification). He, who purified, is successful. (87: 14) Sufi Orders of Islam are the institutions where the basics of Tazkiyah (soul purification) and its practical application are taught. They have graded programs in which every new seeker is instructed in Zikr-e Lisani (oral Zikr) and is finally taught the Zikr-e Qalbi (Remembrance in heart).  ZIKR-E QALBI However, in the Naqshbandia Order, Zikr-e Qalbi is practiced from the very beginning. Adherence to the Sunnah (Prophets way of life) is greatly emphasized in this Order, because the seeker achieves greater and quicker progress through its blessings. The essence of Zikr is that the Qalb should sincerely accept Islamic beliefs and gain the strength to follow the Sunnah with even greater devotion. If the heart is acquainted with Allah and is engaged in His Zikr; then it is filled with Barakaat-e Nabuwwat (Prophetic blessings) which infuse their purity in the mind and body. This not only helps in controlling sensual drives but also removes traces of abhorrence, voracity, envy and insecurity from human soul. The person therefore becomes an embodiment of love, both for the Divine and the corporeal. This is the meaning of a Hadith, There is a lump of flesh in the human body; if it goes astray the entire body is misguided, and if it is reformed the entire body is reformed. Know that this lump is the Qalb.  PAS ANFAS Recent History Khawajah Naqshband (d. 1389 CE) organized the Naqshbandia Order at Bukhara (Central Asia). This Order has two main branches  the Mujaddidia and the Owaisiah. The former is identified with Sheikh Ahmed Sirhindi, known as Mujaddid Alif Sani (literally: reviver of the second Muslim millennium), a successor to Khawajah Baqi Billah, who introduced the Order to the Indo- Pakistan sub-continent. The Owaisiah Order employs a similar method of Zikr but acquires the Prophetic blessings in the manner of Khawajah Owais Qarni, who received this beneficence from the Holy Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) without a formal physical meeting. The Zikr employed by the Naqshbandia is Zikr-e Khafi Qalbi (remembrance of Allahs Name within the heart) and the method is termed Pas Anfas, which (in Persian) means guarding every breath. The Chain of Transmission of these Barakah, of course, emanates from the holy Prophet- SAWS.  SPIRITUAL BAIAT (OATH OF ALLEGIANCE It is necessary in all Sufi Orders that the Sheikh and the seekers must be contemporaries and must physically meet each other for the transfer of these blessings. However, the Naqshbandia Owaisiah Order goes beyond this requirement and Sufis of this Order receive these Barakah regardless of physical meeting with their Sheikh or even when the Sheikh is not their contemporary. Yet, it must be underscored that physical meeting with the Sheikh of this Order still holds great importance in dissemination of these Barakah. Sheikh Sirhindi writes about the Owaisiah Order in his book Tazkirah: It is the most sublime, the most exalted, and the most effectiveand the highest station of all others is only its stepping stone. By far the greatest singular distinction of the Naqshbandia Owaisiah Order is the honor of Spiritual Baiat (Oath of Allegiance) directly at the blessed hands of the holy Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W).  SHEIKH HAZRAT MOULANA ALLAH YAR KHAN (R.A) The Reviver Sheikh Allah Yar Khan was born in Chikrala, a remote village of Mianwali District of Pakistan, in 1904. He completed his religious education in 1934. The same year, he met Sheikh Abdul Rahim, who took him to the shrine of Sheikh Allah Deen Madni. By Divine Will his spiritual connection was immediately established with the saint of the 10th century Hijra (sixteenth century CE) and he started receiving spiritual beneficence. His sublime education in Sufism, signifying progressive spiritual growth and advancement, continued for about twenty-five years, after which he was directed to undertake the propagation of Prophetic blessings - a noble mission that he accomplished with singular zeal and dedication for a period spanning half a century. Anybody who visited him was duly rewarded with a share of spiritual bliss commensurate with his/her sincerity and capacity. Sheikh Allah Yar Khans mission produced men and women of deep spiritual vision and eminence. He authored eighteen books, the most distinguished being Dalael us-Sulook (Sufism - An Objective Appraisal), Hayat-e Barzakhiah (Life Beyond Life) and Israr ul- Haramain (Secrets of the two holy Mosques). He was undoubtedly one of the most distinguished Sufi saints of the Muslim Ummah and a reviver of the Naqshbandia Owaisiah Order. He passed away on 18 February 1984 in Islamabad at the age of eighty.  THE CHAIN OF TRANSMISSION OF NAQSHBANDIA OWAISIAH 1. Hazrat Muhammad ur-Rasool Allah (Sall Allah-o Alaihi wa Sallam), 2. Hazrat Abu Bakr Siddiq (Radhi Allah-o Unho), 3. Hazrat Imam Hassan Basri (Rahmat Ullah Alaihi), 4. Hazrat Daud Tai (Rahmat Ullah Alaihi), 5. Hazrat Junaid Baghdadi (Rahmat Ullah Alaihi), 6. Hazrat Ubaid Ullah Ahrar (Rahmat Ullah Alaihi), 7. Hazrat Abdur Rahman Jami (Rahmat Ullah Alaihi), 8. Hazrat Abu Ayub Muhammad Salih (Rahmat Ullah Alaihi), 9. Hazrat Allah Deen Madni (Rahmat Ullah Alaihi), 10. Hazrat Moulana Allah Yar Khan (Rahmat Ullah Alaihi).  THE SPIRIT OR RUH The spirit or Ruh of every person is a created reflection of the Divine Attributes and it originates in Alam-e Amar (Realm of Command). Its food is the Light of Allah or the Divine Refulgence, which it acquires from the Realm of Command through the holy Prophet Muhammad (may Allahs choicest favors and peace be upon him), whose status in the spiritual world is like that of the sun in the solar system. The Quran refers to him as the bright lamp. Indeed, he is the divinely selected channel of all Barakah. All Exalted Messengers themselves receive these Barakah from him.  LATAIF The human Ruh also possesses vital organs like the physical body; through which it acquires its knowledge, food and energy. These are called Lataif (singular Latifah: subtlety). Scholars of various Sufi Orders have associated them with specific areas of the human body. The Naqshbandia Owaisiah Order identifies these Lataif as follows. First - Qalb: This spiritual faculty is located within the physical heart. Its function is Zikr. Its strength increases ones capacity for Allahs Zikr. Second  Ruh: The site of this Latifah, which is a distinct faculty of the human Ruh, is on the right side of the chest at the level of Qalb. Its primary function is concentration towards Allah. Third  Sirri: This is located above the Qalb and functions to make possible Kashf. Forth  Khaffi: This is located above the Ruh and functions to perceive the omnipresence of Allah. Fifth  Akhfa: This is located in the middle of chest, at the centre of the first four Lataif and makes it possible for the Ruh to perceive the closeness of Allah, Who is closer to us than our own selves. Sixth  Nafs: This Latifah is located at the forehead and functions to purify the human soul. Seventh  Sultan al-Azkar: This Latifah is located at the top centre of the head and serves to absorb the Barakah of Allah into the entire body, so that every cell resonates with Zikr.  FIVE EXALTED MESSENGERS OF GOD There are Five Exalted Messengers among the many known and unknown Messengers of Allah. They are Hazrat Muhammad, Hazrat Nuh (Noah), Hazrat Ibrahim (Abraham), Hazrat Musa (Moses), and Hazrat Esa (Jesus), peace be upon them all. Hazrat Adam is the first Prophet of Allah and the father of mankind. Each Latifah is associated with a particular Prophet. The Barakah and lights from Hazrat Adam (peace be upon him), descend on the first Latifah Qalb; its lights are reflected from the first heaven and are yellowish. The second Latifah is associated with Hazrat Nuh and Hazrat Ibrahim (peace be upon them). Its lights descend from the second heaven and appear as golden red. The lights descending upon the third Latifah are from Hazrat Musa (peace be upon him) and are white. One the fourth Latifah, the lights of Hazrat Esa (peace be upon him) descend from the fourth heaven and are deep blue. The fifth Latifah receives its Barakah directly from the holy Prophet Muhammad (may Allahs choicest favors and peace be upon him). The lights associated with this Latifah are green, descend from the fifth heaven, and overwhelm all the first four Lataif. The Lights descending upon the sixth and seventh Lataif are the Divine Lights, whose color and condition cannot be determined. These are like flashes of lightening that defy comprehension. If Allah blesses a seeker with Kashf, he can observe all of this. The vision is slightly diffused in the beginning, but gradually the clarity improves.  SULOOK Stages of the Path After all seven Lataif of a seeker have been illuminated with Divine Lights through Tawajjuh of the Sheikh and his Ruh has acquired the ability to fly, the Sheikh initiates its journey on the sublime Path of Divine nearness. The Path is known as Sulook, and its stages are not hypothetical imaginations but real and actually existing stations on the spiritual Path. These are also referred to as Meditations, because a seeker mentally meditates about a station while his/her Ruh actually ascends towards it. The first three stations that form the base of whole Sulook are described as; Ahadiyyat, a station of Absolute Unity of Divinity. It is above and beyond the seven heavens. It is so vast a station that the seven heavens and all that they encompass are lost within Ahadiyyat as a ring is lost in a vast desert. Its lights are white in color. Maiyyat station denotes Divine Company, He is with you, wherever you might be. This station is so vast that Ahadiyyat along with the seven heavens beneath are lost within it as a ring is lost in a desert. Its lights are green in color. Aqrabiyyat station denotes Divine Nearness, He is nearer to you than your life- vein. Again, Aqrabiyyat is vast as compared to Maiyyat in the same proportion. Its lights are golden red and are reflected from the Divine Throne. It is indeed the greatest favor of Almighty Allah that He blesses a seeker with an accomplished Sheikh, who takes him to these sublime stations. The final station that a seeker attains to during his/her lifetime becomes his/her Iliyyeen (blessed abode) in Barzakh and his/her Ruh stays at this station after death.   ZIKR Why is Zikr Necessary for Everyone? Allah ordains every soul in the Quran to Perform Zikr. This not only means reciting the Quran and Tasbeeh but also Zikr-e Qalb. It is only through Zikr-e Qalbi that Prophetic Lights reach the depths of human soul and purify it from all vice and evil. Zikr infuses a realization of constant Divine Presence and a seeker feels great improvement in the level of sincerity and love towards Allah and the holy Prophet- SAWS. Such levels of sincerity, love and feelings of Divine Presence can never be obtained without Zikr. It would be a mistake to believe that Zikr may be a requirement only for the very pious and virtuous people. Zikr provides the Prophetic blessings which are in effect the life line of every human soul. It transforms even the most corrupted humans into virtuous souls by bringing out the best in them. The fact is that Zikr is the only way to achieve true contentment and satisfaction in life. The holy Quran has pointed to this eternal fact that it is only through Zikr Allah that hearts can find satisfaction. Such satisfaction and peace are the ultimate requirements of every person, regardless of religion, race and ethnicity. Practicing Zikr regularly removes all traces of anxiety and restlessness, and guides the human soul to eternal bliss and peace.  KHALIFA MAJAZEEN Hazrat Moulana Allah Yar Khan (R.A), during his life time in 1974, presented a nomination list to Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W), during Maraqba, of expected Khalifa Majazeen for Silsila Naqshbandia Awaisia. Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) approved some names, deleted some of the names, and added down the name of Major Ghulam Muhammad as also Khalifa Majaaz of Silsila Naqshbandia Awaisia (which was not previously included in the list)  The approved names at that time included:  1. Mr. Muhammad Akram Awan Sahib,  2. Mr. Sayed Bunyad Hussain Shah Sahib,  3. Mr. Major Ahsan Baig Sahib,  4. Mr. Col. Matloob Hussain Sahib,  5. Mr. Major Ghulam Muhammad Sahib of Wan Bhachran Mianwali,  6. Mr. Molvi Abdul Haq Sahib,  7. Mr. Hafiz Abdul Razzaq Sahib,  8. Mr. Hafiz Ghulam Qadri Sahib,  9. Mr. Khan Muhammad Irani Sahib,  10. Mr. Maolana Abdul Ghafoor Sahib,  11. Mr. Syed Muhammad Hassan Sahib of Zohb.  These Majazeen were authorized to; held Majalis of Zikar (Pas Anfas) in their respective areas, arrange Majalis of Zikar in neighboring areas, train them on the way of Sulook, prepare them for Spiritual Baiat (Oath of Allegiance), and present them to Sheikh Hazrat Moulana Allah Yar Khan for Spiritual Baiat at the Hand of Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W), in the life of Hazrat Moulana Allah Yar Khan (R.A), and were all equal in status as Khalifa Majaaz of Hazrat Moulana Allah Yar Khan (R.A).  Presently we are following Hazrat Major  Ghulam Muhammad Sahib, Khalifa Majaaz of Hazrat Moulana Allah Yar Khan (R.A). "

During my trip in early April Mom & I had a chat about what she wanted for her funeral.  She said she wanted it to include family stories and have some gospel principals.  I felt fine talking about family stories.  I felt I should defer to others speakers who were active in Mom's church for the religious comments.    I jotted down some notes during the layover on my return flight to North Carolina.  When I got the phone call a week later saying Mom was in a coma, I felt I needed to write a draft of the talk while I had access to my PC at home.  I did not have a problem with the beginning of the talk.  I had too many stories for the middle of the talk.  I could not figure out how to end the talk.  When I arrived in Utah after Mom's death, I learned that one of the speakers who was going to give the more religious talk was unexpectedly out of the country.  That meant my talk would be longer than I had anticipated, but I still needed to cut out a few of the family stories.  I decided to add a few spiritual beliefs that I shared with Mom, even though I am not a church goer.  I continued to struggle with how to end the talk.  I wrote several versions but something seemed to be missing.  I woke up at 3:00 a.m the day of the funeral and had some thoughts on how to end the tribute.  I did not go back to sleep.  I finally got up a little after 5:00 a.m., ate breakfast, and drove to Antelope Island State Park to mentally compose the ending of my talk.  I had not shot any photos since arriving in Utah five days earlier.  This was the last photo I took, as I drove on the causeway across the Great Salt Lake back to my brother's home.  I put my thoughts in writing, re-read them silently and then aloud to myself, and felt that Mom would be satisfied.  I have edited out the surnames in the following posting since I mention a number of people in the talk.  Thus, it may be a bit awkward to read.  I am also adding some photos from the digital photo display we had at the viewing.  I had never seen many of the older photos, so they have that much more meaning to me.  I'll make this posting private in a few days.    Please do not fave it since that makes it public in your Faves. _______________________________________________________________  On a spring morning in 1921, Ada awoke to a special announcement  she was pregnant.  It was not a new experience  she had five children - but it was unexpected news.  She would be 42, and her husband Frank would be 54, when this baby was born.  Some 50+ years later while chatting with Ada, my grandma, I asked what her first thoughts were when she discovered she was having my Mom.  Her response shocked me  Frank, I will never forgive you for doing this to me.  She immediately followed up with, But as I look over my life, having Betty, Janet, and Stuart in my later years has been my greatest blessing. Frances and Marge are in their 70s and are not able to care for me between themselves. Having the younger children has allowed me to spend time with my children without being a burden to any one child.  We are here today to celebrate and honor the blessing of knowing, of loving, and of being loved by Betty  my Mom.  Mom was born into an active, loving, diverse three generation family.   Her Grandma, 83 at the time, crossed the plains as a Mormon pioneer.   Her father Frank, came to America, via Canada, as a 16 year old looking for a better life than the one that was available to him in England.  Her mother, Ada, was a lively, beautiful young woman who took on the challenges of raising her family and providing mutual support to her mother while Frank was away with his work as a mining engineer.  Moms older siblings married and moved away around the time Mom entered Stoker School. The family soon grew to include grandchildren.  In particular, Mom had closeness to Margie, Phyllis, and Renee, who were more like sisters than nieces. She loved her nephew Stan, who was always good for providing entertainment for the family.  The family was touched by the deaths of two grandsons, Grandma, Moms father  Frank, and her oldest brother, also named Frank, between 1931 and 1934.  These experiences drew Mom, who was always close to her Mother, even closer. They gave her the desire to enjoy the time she had with family and the hope of being reunited with loved ones after death.  In junior high Mom became a talented seamstress. One afternoon while my Grandma was out, Mom took apart a blouse so she could study the pieces of cloth, figure out how they were sewn together, and re-sewed the blouse to show Grandma what she had learned.  She was a member of the yearbook staff at Davis High School.  Upon graduation she went to work at Morrison  Merrill Lumber Company. She took the Civil Service exam and was hired on at Hill Air Force Base as the first secretary in the Engineering Department. When she left Hill Field a few years later she was one of only two secretaries at the base who held a GS 6 grade level.  Around the time Mom went to Hill Field, a young man named Richard entered her life.  He moved from Brigham City to Bountiful the previous summer to attend LDS Business College. He lived with Jim and Wynona, his uncle and aunt, who were neighbors of Moms family.  To quote from Moms personal history:  Two girls in our neighborhood asked me if I wanted to join with them to see who could get the first date with that good looking Richard who had just come to town. I replied that I wouldnt make a fool of myself for any boy. That is the reason I had made myself scarce when he was around. He thought I was stuck up, but I really wasnt.  For Dads perspective, I will now quote from his personal history: The (Moms) family lived in the house south of us. She was a widow with a boy and two girls still at home. I knew Stuart and Janet quite well but thought Betty Jean was a very stuck up person since she seldom if ever joined in any of our conversations. I did take notice that she came out and sat on their front porch in her shorts when I was working in our yard. She claims it was unintentional but I claim it was too often to be just accidental.  And so, while our Mom was a flirt, she was a selective flirt.  One day in August 1941 as Betty and Dick passed each other on the sidewalk, they spoke to each other. Out of nowhere he asked if she would like to go to a show.  To his surprise she accepted. He had just asked for the first date in his life.  They went to a movie at the Center Theatre in Salt Lake, and to quote from Dads personal history again, It was not nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be. In fact it was quite enjoyable so in about a week I gave it another try.  Continuing from Dads history: We seemed to enjoy being together but the bravest I got for our first five dates was to hold her hand occasionally in a show and then hold her hand while walking her to the door when we got home. On our next date we were parked in from of her house.I casually put my arm across the back of the seat and then moved it down on her shoulder. Before I knew what was happening she moved across the seat to my side and gave me a kiss that just about took my breath away..It took me a couple of minutes to recover and I will admit that I returned the favor.  Mom and Dad married on April 10, 1942, in the Salt Lake Temple. Over the years she taught him how to be a husband, and later on how to be a father.  As a child I liked the fact that our names rhymed: Dee Ann, Ilene, Dennis, and Dean.  When I learned there was an older sister, Annette, who died as a baby, I wanted to know more about her.  Annettes death was the greatest sorrow and challenge in Moms life.  At this point Id like to talk about some of Moms traits and interests, and how they have been shared among family members.  Mom was a sweet person, much like her Grandma and her own mother. Each loved being a Mother, and being a Grandmother was an especially wonderful experience.  That love of being a Mom and a Grandma is shared by Dee Ann and Ilene. And Dennis and I, though less prolific than our sisters, really enjoy being Dads.  In spite of that sweetness, Mom had a less frequently manifested but humorous trait that could be defined as the Let me yank your chain gene.  This was demonstrated when Mom was a toddler, learning to speak, and her sister Marge was taking a high school typing class.  Each time Marge made a mistake she would slam the typewriter carriage back and let out a few choice words.   Mom stood by Marges side saying, Mate mitates Mowgie  mate mitates.  Dennis probably inherited the largest share of the Let me yank your chain gene.   For example, when I was 3 the family got Ginger, a beautiful Seal Point Siamese cat.  Dennis, being the logical and mathematical seven year old that he was, declared that since Ginger was the family cat, we each owned 1/6th of Ginger.  Furthermore, the part of Ginger we owned was based on age, with Mom  a few months older than Dad  owning Gingers head.  Dennis carefully explained to me the parts that our parents, sisters, and he owned, and then informed me that, as the youngest member of the family, I owned Gingers tail and rear end.  That made me mad and I ran crying to Mom.  She asked what had happened and I explained Denniss allocation of Ginger according to age.  Mom comforted me for a few seconds and then said since she owned Gingers head, she would give me her share of Ginger.  I went back to Dennis and announced that I now owned 2/6ths of Ginger  her head in addition to her tail and rear end.  That love of pets is a shared trait among our family.  Being raised during the great Depression, Mom and Dad were both fiscally conservative.  As funds became more available, they did enjoy a few indulgences.  For example, Mom loved shoes. Im not sure about Dee Ann, but I think Ilene shares that trait with Mom.   Dennis, on the other hand, wears sandals when ever possible and on occasion has been caught in the snow with sandals.   My least favorite article of clothing to sell when I worked for Mac was shoes, and they are still my least favorite article of clothing to buy.  Mom and Dad could be a bit humorous with their definition of fiscal conservatism. They did not buy a set of fine china until they had been married around 25 years. They felt it would be spending too much to buy sterling silver at the same time.  A few years later they went to ZCMI. The item they were looking for was sold out so as they were leaving the store, Dad said they needed to buy something so he would not have to pay for parking.  Mom walked over to the china and silver department and said, How about a set of sterling silver?  It was one of their more expensive free parking validations.  On the few occasions when Mom disagreed with Dad, she referred to him as your father.  About 15 years ago I received a letter from Mom  typed on her PC  that had some unusual formatting problems.  Midway through the letter, she wrote, Excuse the appearance, but your father wont support my word processing software any more and is making me learn a new program.  Within 3 weeks Mom mastered the new software and Dad once again became Dad in her letters.  Around the same time at work we were installing our first software that would load new accounts directly onto our main processing system.  During a meeting with one of our offices, a lady named Mary, who was in her 60s, said she did not think she could learn our new software.  I told her about my Mom learning new software in her 70s and said that within 3 weeks she had it down pat.  Mary found encouragement in Moms example, and shared it with several other employees.  Without realizing it, Mom became an inspiration to four or five ladies in central North Carolina who needed to learn some new programs.  Mom loved Bountiful and her homes and life with Dad and their family, friends, and neighbors.  She had no desire to travel widely, but enjoyed some special trips with family.  The first was a trip California with Francis & Clyde, who took her to visit Marge and Glen.  The next was our familys tour of the Eastern States before we returned home after our time in Ohio.  Mom and Dad loved their trip to the northwest and into British Columbia with Aunt Janet and Uncle Dwight. The two couples were more than relatives  they were great friends.  The other big trip was Moms tour of Europe with Phyllis, courtesy of Dad and Don.  Next to Annettes passing, Moms next greatest challenges were her longing for Dad after his death in 2002, and having to move from her home in 2007.  Our visits and phone conversations could be both sweet and bittersweet.   Last December, while trying to decide what to give Mom for Christmas, I concluded there was a limit to the number of trinkets or floral arrangements that could fit in her apartment, and that she would probably be happiest spending Christmas Day together.   It was one of our shortest but most enjoyable visits. I returned home to North Carolina, grateful to have spent what would probably be my last Christmas and my last visit with Mom.  When Moms latest series of medical challenges began there were a series of phone calls and e-mails about Moms condition, her prognosis, her ups, and her downs.  One trait we four children share with Mom and Dad is that all of us are pragmatic  possibly too pragmatic.  With various issues back home in North Carolina, there were no suggestions or hints that I needed to come to Utah for this latest medical round.   I had decided that I would come out for Mothers Day, which fit better into my schedule.  The morning of April 6, after taking care of my dogs, I went into the bathroom to prepare for the work day.  As I splashed hot water on my face to shave, I looked in the mirror and thought  Mothers Day might be too late.  I dried my face and hands, walked into my study, and booked a flight to Utah.  It was a visit with some very nice highs - especially the evening of Mom and Dads anniversary - and a few of the hardest episodes that made me wonder why Mom had to endure some of the things she was experiencing.  Our last visit was poignant. I did not want it to end, and turned around three times and went back to Mom before I finally left. She handled it better than I did and smiled with contentment while I cried and tried to regain my composure.  The final cycle began last Sunday with a call to let me know Mom was being transferred to McKay Dee Hospital and that she was in a coma.  There were a series of phone calls with each of the siblings and spouses over the next few hours.   Mom was in a coma, and the tests showed that her vital organs were shutting down.  The final call from a tearful Dennis told me that based on the medical results and Moms lack of responsiveness, the decision had been made to let her go.  The next hour or two were a slow motion whirlwind as I wrote a version of this talk, searched out travel options, and spoke with Aaron who lives in Seattle.  After hearing no further word, I called Denniss cell phone and asked for an update.  Moms life began as a shock and a blessing, and that is how it ended.  He said, Mom is sitting up and we are reminiscing about pets.   I said, What?  He said, Were talking about Ginger. Let me put you on the speaker phone so you can join the conversation.  What followed was a ten minute chat, much like the conversations we had years ago before age and illness afflicted Mom and Dad.  When I asked, How are you doing, Mom? she replied, Well, Ive been better and Ive been worse.  I called Aaron to let him know Mom was suddenly conscious, coherent, and talking, and he called Denniss cell phone and joined in the conversation.  Mom said how nice it was to have Dee Ann and Von, Ilene and Dave, and Dennis, Ann, and Judd there with her and to have spoken with Aaron and me on the phone.  Around 2:00 a.m. Monday morning I booked another flight to Utah. As I finished packing a few hours later, Dennis called and gave me the news  Mom was gone.  It took me a while to process and comprehend that final chat with Mom and the family, and I could not really put it into context until I arrived in Utah and was filled in on the details.  The more I thought about it, I felt a sense a peace that among last conversations we had as a family with Mom was about one of the subjects most dear to each of us  our cats and our dogs.  Throughout her life Mom always stated her wishes, but then she would add, Thy will be done.  She did not want Annette to die, but accepted that she did not get to raise Annette on earth.  She did not want to die in a hospital, but in the end accepted that would be what happened.  I believe that once Mom accepted thy will be done, the Lord gave Mom and us a miracle, in the form of a final, enjoyable, entertaining, last visit.  Ive struggled with how to end the talk. Around 3:00 a.m. this morning, the thought came that I should conclude by sharing a few thoughts about my relationship with Mom.  I am the bonus baby  the one born after three miscarriages, one death, two near deaths, and one healthy but small baby.  In 1939 Mom received her Patriarchal Blessing which stated sons and daughters would be born to her.  After seven pregnancies resulting in two daughters to raise and one son, I feel it took a great deal of courage  and faith  to risk one more pregnancy in hopes of having a second son.  I think Aaron, Ilene & Dave, and Dennis & Ann were a bit concerned about me yesterday when we went to see Mom at the funeral home.  She looked beautiful, but we each grieve in our own way, and seeing her body did not bring me a lot of peace.  What brings me peace is reading her life story, and the letters we exchanged over the years.  What brings me peace is looking at the photos and remembering our experiences over the years.  What brings me peace is listening to a voice mail she left after flowers and chocolates were delivered for Valentines Day, and hearing her end with her signature sign off  I love you, I love you, I love you.  The final thing that brings me peace is that Mom  after 65 years  will finally spend Mothers Day with Annette.  Annette was born on May 8, 1945. She died on May 12, 1945, a Saturday, around midnight. The next morning  Mothers Day  Mom learned that her first baby had died.  To Annette  Thank you for letting us have these years with Mom - please give her some extra hugs from each of us.  And to Mom, I love you, I love you, I love you.  I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

No trees, no barns, no houses. The sky was not as brilliant as I had hoped it would be and as it was the day before. In order to have a fast enough ss to catch my jump, I had the ISO cranked to 3200, so it's noisy and darker than it actually was, but I wanted to avoid motion blur. The results weren't exactly as I had envisioned, but it's okay.  Hope everyone has a great weekend!! Happy Friday!!

Alternate title: if you can't jump on the bed in a hotel, where CAN you?  +++  Wow wow WOW what a year. I don't think all of my years have been so full of change, so the one I decide to document makes up for it, hey?     I decided to start 365 for a few reasons: one, to pick up my camera every day. I bought my Nikon D50 in the summer of 2005 and used it, oh maybe 10 times. For real. I have always loved photography and bought the camera to try to have better equipment, but I did not know how to use it and I got frustrated and my little P&S was easier to carry around.     I also did it to try to improve upon my creativity. Taking a photo of the same subject for 365 days straight can get pretty boring! Lastly, I did it for the simple reason of keeping a journal of my year, of sorts.     When my 'year' started, I was living in Florida, miserable, and traveling to NYC most every weekend. I had been seeing someone there but then we broke up but I fell in love with the city, met new friends, and decided to move there. Even with all the travel my life was definitely missing something, and I was feeling like I was getting old and would never have the things in life I wanted: namely, happiness and contentment.     I was getting excited with the prospect of moving. I didn't really have a ""plan"", but I have often been the type of person to act on instinct and sometimes not plan well enough; it usually works itself out. I don't want to miss a chance of something that could be IT.     Then a wrench got thrown in my plans. There was this guy I saw around on some of my contacts contacts, then he popped up during my friend Hilary's ""International Tootsie Pop Week"". There was just something about him...I mean yeah the obvious hotness, but all the other similarities: being vegetarian, having a big dog, loving the outdoors and the mountains, same political + religious + moral views, and so much more. But he was married, and lived in Denver.     Denver! Hmm...in 2006 I was debating a move to Denver. My friend Chris lived in Boulder for many years and LOVED it and wants to come back to CO so badly, but his wife does not. He knew I was miserable in FL, I wanted to go somewhere, and while I love and miss Portland (Oregon) dearly (where I lived between CA and FL), MY ex-husband is there so I wanted to find a new place to live. Denver was sounding promising...but then I met the guy in NYC, blah blah blah.     I started thinking about Denver again. NYC was still #1 choice but I also knew there was a HUGE chance I would be living off of Top Ramen daily, IF I was lucky. I decided I would still keep my options open. And I decided I would get to know this Flickr due because, well, it is nice to have friends in new cities, right? And he never seemed to talk about his wife and then I saw no wedding ring where I saw one before so I thought MAYBE I was mistaken about him being married. And if nothing else, his photography was some of the best I had seen. A little bizarre at times (and by a little I mean a LOT), but still captivating.     But then, as my brother would say, it was my LUCKY DAY! I discovered that this hott Denver guy was SINGLE! I mean, not that he would ever want ME...he didn't even know who I was! If you look at his Flickr stream he had about 23089472389074023947  (give or take 10) women DAILY commenting on how hot and wonderful and funny and amazing and and and and and that he was...I was SURE he had no shortages of dates. So...I decided to contact him. I mean it seemed weird, but rejection over the internet has got to be easier than face-to-face, right? So I decided to ask him about Colorado. And he responded back! And he told me some things, but then I saw that the conversation could die, QUICKLY, so I just kept making up reasons to talk to him...and he kept talking back!     Flickrmails turned into emails which turned into gchats which turned into phone calls which turned into him doing a hell of a lot of research to find out where I worked and sent me flowers to me which led to me (with a few other things in between) deciding to take a chance and MOVE there -  before I even met him in person!!!     We finally DID meet in person, 15 days before I was to officially move (or, I moved 11 days after I left his house). I was SO SCARED I wanted to crawl in a hole. I was so scared he would not like me, or think I was boring or stupid or whatever...and the moment I saw him, I just KNEW. There were so many things that I worried about: his ex-wife, the fact that he had kids (I always wanted kids, but I had never dated anyone with kids, and I remember what a brat I was to the people my mom dated), the fact I was MOVING ACROSS COUNTRY with a BIG part of it being for the guy (I had actually decided I should PLAN of it and save some money and all that jazz and I ended up finding a job opening with my company like 3-4 WEEKS after entertaining the idea of moving at all), and you know, a million other things.     But the moment I saw him, I just KNEW that none of it mattered, and if there was any issues, they would work out. Nothing had ever felt more right than being there with him. The fact I had to go 11 days before seeing him again was TORTURE. I knew I was in love with him then and there (though I certainly did not mention that fact for a couple months as I did not want to scare him off, but hey, when you know, you know) and honestly, I don't know how some of these other Flickr couples do it  11 days before he flew to Jacksonville to come get me and drive across country with me and it was the longest of my life.     But I am here now, and with him, and we are living together, and we have already had a lot happen...but when he is there it is all okay. He is completely absolutely THE ONE for me and I have never felt so strongly about this ever. Not even when I was married before!     A lot happened besides that. But I wanted to focus on that because it is such a HUGE part of my year, and where I am today, and where I WILL be in the future. I moved  twice! Once across country and once in-town from my apartment I rarely saw to his house. I got fired from my job of 10 years. My father died. Dave's beautiful, sweet, awesome 8 year old dog died. I started a new job. I went from having a single life to having a boyfriend, which also came with 2 kids, an ex-wife with a new husband, all her family, not to mention HIS family. I adore his family  which is important to me. And then of course, there is the everyday stuff. Some good; some bad. I met some Flickr friends who now, to me, are simply FRIENDS, not 'Flickr Friends', and I adore them so much  Brigid, Rachel, Jessi, James. We got 2 dogs together.     And of course, I learned about myself, improved upon my photography and editing, and became truly passionate about a hobby I always WANTED to indulge in but never felt I was good enough.     And of course, thank you to all of you who have been so supportive this last year. I mean it. Sometimes it is hard to keep going without support.     And NOW, I am going to STFU because we are in VEGAS and I need to GO HAVE SOME FUN with Dave!!! As of now I have NOT decided if I willdo a Year 2, or take a break, or continue on with YIP and include SP's. I do not know if I will start tomorrow or take a few days/weeks off. I guess we will see how I feel tomorrow!     oxoxoxo, ~Tara     50 Random Facts About Me #50: When I first discovered Dave on Flickr, and started to learn more about him through his photos and the rare time he let in on his personal life, he was married, but I did not know he was in the process of a divorce. So, since I thought he was taken, I thought to myself, ""This is the kind of man I want to marry. Since this seemingly awesome guy is taken I hope I find a guy exactly like him because he seems like everything I could ever want in a partner"". This is 100% truthful, and maybe a little weird, but I just KNEW a person like him (if not him, himself) was the One for me. I could FEEL it and I knew if I had a guy like him, I would have my soulmate, if there is such a thing.  Now I KNOW there is such a thing. I have never felt anything like it. But when you know...you KNOW.  (and no we are not married, I have had many friends, family and coworkers ask me if this is why we were coming here for 6 days, and there are no plans to do it now or in the future, but I can tell you I am not going anywhere, so...)   And this part, I was not going to do, but for Dave, because he is such a stats geek ;-)  Total Days: 363.5 Days Missed: Depends on you you look at it! On Day 42 I was in NYC and completely forgot to take one, so I made this one up. I did have a pretty fun night! And apparently I missed Day 79 completely, but the thing is, I KNOW I took one that day. I know it! That was back when I was lazy and took a lot of webcam shots if I did not feel like messing with the camera so I am guessing I accidentally deleted it. Boo!

He's still a bit skittish, but with Rufus, he's just blossomed into a total love-monster. From standoffish he's become one of the most loving, sweet kitties ever. I'm convinced that part of it has to do with the love and acceptance that Rufus has shown him. Maybe that's anthropomorphizing overly - but it's hard to deny the look of pure contentment on their faces when they snuggle together."

Even after the establishment of the Ming dynasty in 1368 Ni continued the life of a wanderer, visiting old haunts that he had not seen for twenty or thirty years. According to his epitaph writer, Zhou Nanlao (1308-1383), in his late years, he became quieter and more withdrawn than ever. Having lost or given away everything he ever owned, he did his best to forget his worries. Wearing a yellow [Daoist] cap and country clothes, he roamed the lakes and mountains, leading a recluses life.  Woods and Valleys of Mountain Yu, executed two years before Ni Zans death, expresses the painters contentment in the life of a recluse. The poem ends with the lines:  We watch the clouds and daub with our brushes We drink wine and write poems. The joyous feelings of this day Will linger long after we have parted.  The dry but tender brushwork is aloof and restrained. There is a tranquil luminous quality about the painting that makes it one of the most fully realized works of the artists later years.

Anthropy is thus every action of Man while on Earth  between fellow men and between men and the Planet. It is the relationship of all these actions with the vision of the Universe in which Man and Planet are found.  Entropy is the variation of energy in a system during any transformation  it is the same as the quantity of energy that the system exchanges with the environment. The first law of Entropy does not limit the possibilities of transforming one energy into another. This first principle establishes that energy cannot be created nor destroyed.  Garden is a word derived from Hebrew, comprising the prefix gan, which means protect or defend, implying a notion of enclosure or privacy, and the expression oden or eden, which transmits a sensation of pleasure or contentment.  The etymological interpretation of this word is reflected in the concept of privacy of land for leisure or contentment.  Gardens are an aesthetic expression of human ideas and a concrete expression of mans relationship with nature.  The forest represent the total phenomenon, it is nature in its greatest manifestation. The forest lays a role rich in meanings, which makes it a place of beginnings."

Anthropy is thus every action of Man while on Earth  between fellow men and between men and the Planet. It is the relationship of all these actions with the vision of the Universe in which Man and Planet are found.  Entropy is the variation of energy in a system during any transformation  it is the same as the quantity of energy that the system exchanges with the environment. The first law of Entropy does not limit the possibilities of transforming one energy into another. This first principle establishes that energy cannot be created nor destroyed.  Garden is a word derived from Hebrew, comprising the prefix gan, which means protect or defend, implying a notion of enclosure or privacy, and the expression oden or eden, which transmits a sensation of pleasure or contentment.  The etymological interpretation of this word is reflected in the concept of privacy of land for leisure or contentment.  Gardens are an aesthetic expression of human ideas and a concrete expression of mans relationship with nature.  The forest represent the total phenomenon, it is nature in its greatest manifestation. The forest lays a role rich in meanings, which makes it a place of beginnings."

Thing is, we had a lot of traveling to go, and I didn't really want anything. So, I offered up a few baht for a photo. I probably could have taken the photo anyways, but the promise of a few baht put her in a good mood. It was well worth it.  Per Wikipedia, ""The Akha are hill tribe of subsistence farmers known for their artistry. The ethnic group may have originated in Mongolia around 1500 years ago. Most of the remaining Akha people are now distributed in small villages among the mountains of China, Laos (where they are considered Lao Sung), Myanmar (Burma), and northern Thailand, where they are one of the six main hill tribes.  The Akha began arriving in Thailand in the early twentieth century and continue to immigrate, with some 80,000 now living in Thailand's northern provinces of Chiang Rai and Chiang Mai at high altitudes.""  1/1500 sec at f4/5 and ISO 400.

Still, I move my pencil across the page as I sit at my porch-desk-sanctuary.  It glides, nurtures  wonders. Up, down  I see it, I notice. It blends.  I notice the sounds as the occur around me.  Bird song. Jay squawk.   Cars tires woosh. Airplane pushing the air  aside, pummeling its way through the once still  sky vapors bullying towards the airport. Lawn  mower, too loud. A second lawn mower  or  is it leaf blower? Too loud.  I wish the noises (except for the birds)  would just cut it out.  Stop already.  I need to stay home, work, write, be.  I notice Joel drive past, slightly late to work again.  A ridiculously loud bird. Sheesh. The  thing is screeching.  The tree in front of me attracts me, calls me towards it. I pick up my ever present  camera to hold my witness of it in  image form, to be revisited as desired.   I snap. And snap. And snap. Different angles,  different light, I see the tears on the side of the tree. My heart responds, differently now.  I realize without realizing that it has been divinity, calling me.  Silence falls. I hear the unusual, gravelly lusty bird call and photograph the black birds, flirting as they sit on a branch of my palm tree.  I photograph the pine tree, bleeding, in the  places where its limbs were severed to keep Sam safe. I look up into the tree heart and notice,  suddenly, it is no longer hot. The wind is blowing, gently.  The pine needles sing gratitude.  I smile, contentment filling my lips as they turn up just slightly. My heart joins my lips in a knowing smile.  I move to my desk to write.  The birds sing, more melodiously, it seems.  I listen. The sound fills me with gratitude now  that I spent just a flash of an eternal moment,  draped in silence. All the while, I am guessing,  the lawn mowers were blaring and the vehicles were driving by and all the extra stuff  was making noise.  I wished, in writing, for the noises to go away.  That wish opened the door to my wish being granted,  my request being received with intense passion.   My Mirado black warrior leaves hearts on the page.  A jeep wrangler drives past and a pool cleaner purposefully declares the day productive.  Yes. It most certainly is."

Ill On the 25th of April, before the trees were inleaf, I heard the first true wood-note of thespring. It came from the tall oaks beyond thegarden.

The solitary vireo !It was his whistle, inimitable, unmistakable ; andthough I had not seen him since last July, I hur-ried out to the woods, sure he would greet me.

He did more than show himself: he sang forme.

Such variety of notes, suchsweetness of melody, such easy, unconscious ren-dering ! It was a love-song, but sung all tohimself, for he knew that theie was no gentleheart to listen this side of Virginia. He sang to his own happy heart as pure and sweet a songas the very angels know. Solitary disappeared from that day. I con-cluded he had gone to heavier, wilder woods tonest. It was late in June that, passing throughthis brush-land, I saw hanging from an oak sap-ling, just above my head, a soft, yellowish basket.It was a vireos nest; but it was too large, toodowny, too yellow for Eed-eye. There were nobunches of white spider-webs upon it, such asRed-eye hangs all over his nest. I stepped asidefor a better view, and had just caught the glintof a large, white-ringed eye peering over thenests edge at me, when, off in the woods behindme, the noon hush was startled by Solitaryswhistlea round, pure, pearly note that brokethe quiet as pearly teeth brea   Note About Images Please note that these images are extracted from scanned page images that may have been digitally enhanced for readability - coloration and appearance of these illustrations may not perfectly resemble the original work."

Hungry to touch the love of my soul. Wanting to know the One who can make me whole. A walk in the park to meet my Beloved. The day moves by so slow, every hour is coveted. I long to hear the voice of the lark,  As I long for the walk in the park. A voice so sweet the melody sings,  As a tender enchanting dream. The voice heals and beckons me on. Bringing me inner joy and contentment,  As I am filled with a song. A walk in the park with the one I call Lord. A walk in the park with the One I adore.  I desire this moment away But even within the spirit I can find this escape. I close my eyes and I am with Him. I am walking on a narrow road over the glen. Each moment away in this secrete place Is a sacred gem that I find in Him. A walk in the park is only a prayer. I can connect to the Maker above,  And He can lead me into oceans of love. A walk in the park with the King of my heart I am lifted away to a majestic escape And returned with unspeakable joy And love to embrace.

According to Nyingma sources, this tantra was first taught in India by Garab Dorje (dga rab rdo rje), who lived three hundred and sixty years after the historical Buddha, to Manjusrimitra. Eventually, it was transmitted to Tibet. The Emporer Trisong Detsen hid the scripture in the eighth century, and it was revealed as Terma (gter ma), or treasure text, by Dangma Lhngyel (Davidson, 230). According to Ronald Davidson, the written version of the seventeen tantras was most probably a product of the Ch (lce) clan in the eleventh and twelfth centuries (228).  The contents of this text deal with the teaching of the bardos (bar do), or intermediate states, that all beings are subject to. Although the number of intermediate states ranges from four to six depending on the source, the Tantra of the Great Secret Union of the Sun and Moon names five: the bardo of nature, the bardo of the state of samadhi, the bardo of dream, the bardo of birth and death, and the bardo of existence. This discussion on the bardos predates the more popularly known treatment of the bardos in the fourteenth century treasure text, Self Liberation Through Hearing (Bar do thos grol) .   Character  This tantra is in sangiti form, in which the buddha Dorje Chang (rdo rje chang, Skt. Vajradhara) teaches esoteric Buddhist doctrine to a bodhisattva (Orofino, 20). The bodhisattva in this tantra is Mitog Thuba (mi rtog thub pa) who asks Dorje Chang a series of questions concerning how sentient beings can attain liberation in the various intermediate states. Most of the text is in verse.   Summary  The first section of this text, discussing the Bardo of Present Life (rang bzhin bar do) is not available in English translation. It contains detailed explanations of a yoga system that allows practitioners to control and channel their physical and mental energies towards the goal of spiritual enlightenment (Orofino, 20).  The second section of the text is devoted to the Bardo of Death (chi khaii bar do). Mitog Thuba asks Dorje Chang to explain the signs of death, and methods of preventing death if one sees these signs. Dorje Chang discusses various signs of death. For example, if ones nose flattens out, he will die in five days, or, if black spots appear on ones tongue, he will die after two days (Orofino 22-23). He goes on to explain magical rituals that one can perform to reverse the course of death. Then, the buddha in the dialogue suddenly switches from Dorje Chang to Vajrasattva. Mitog Thuba asks Vajrasattva, how one is to recognize the pure state of wisdom at the moment of death.   Vajrasattvas reply begins with a description of the physical process of death: at death, the various elements of ones body dissolve into each other - earth into earth, water into water, fire into fire, and air into air. Each of these dissolutions is accompanied by a physical sign like the cooling of the body or the stiffening of the limbs.   The moment of death, though, also represents an opportunity to unify ones mind with the wisdom of the Buddha, thus achieving enlightenment. This involves taking the ""position of the sleeping lion,"" entering into a state of profound meditation, and then directing the mind to the eyes. In a moment of pure focus, where pure awareness is concentrated into a single point, the person achieves enlightenment and does not have to wander in the bardo. This, however, is a very difficult task to perform.   Vajrasattva outlines particular ways that a master or dharma brother can help a dying practitioner perform this task.  The third section of this text deals with the Bardo of Essential Reality (chos nyid bar do). Vajrasattva explains that during the Bardo of Essential Reality, one sees visions of the mandala of the five rays of light. One sees ""subtle, mobile, trembling, quivering, scintillating"" masses of multi-coloured light which shine ""disctinctly and marvelously"". One experiences the light from ones heart engaging with these visions. Finally, one experiences the eight ways in which the light arises. This represents an opportunity for liberation - if one understands that these visions are manifestations of ones own mind, one attains enlightenment. If not, one will be frightened, and will enter into the next bardo, the Bardo of Existence.  The final section discusses the Bardo of Existence (srid pai bardo) where the individual begins the process of being reborn into a new body. In this intermediate state, the individual sees visions of the six types of beings: gods, demi-gods, animals, hungry spirits, hell-beings, and humans. One also sees visions of temples, houses, hoards of people, desert land, caves, ruins, and precipices. The latter three visions represent future rebirth in a womb. Vajrasattva then describes the development of the fetus after the individual has entered into the womb, and finishes by reminding Mitog Thuba that transmigration is an unending cycle that one can only escape through wisdom.   Analysis and Interpretation     Life and Death   One of the most remarkable things about this text is its treatment of the themes of life and death. In our culture, death is seen as a profoundly negative thing. Suffice to say, death is not a preferred topic of discussion either in the public or the private sphere. Death represents failure--the failure of the surgeon to fix a childs heart, the failure of an individual to ""hold on"" to life, or the failure of a cancer patient to ""beat"" the illness. In contrast, life is what people desperately hold onto, and, in their quest for eternal life, people willingly spending large sums of money on face lifts, anti-aging creams, and antioxidants. In our culture, we tend to focus on life and to be in a perpetual state of denial about death.  In the Tantra of the Great Secret Union of the Sun and Moon, on the other hand, life is not particularly glorified and death is not particularly belittled. This text speaks of life and death in a candid and matter-of-fact sort of way. In keeping with basic Buddhist doctrine, the tantra describes life as impermanent, and invokes a series of similes: life is like a ""dream,"" ""rushing water,"" ""wind,"" ""magical enchantment,"" ""illusion,"" and itinerant ""pilgrim,"" and a ""rain cloud"" that will pass over soon (Orofino, 31). These similes convey a sense of the ungraspable nature of life; no matter how hard we try, we can never make things stand still. The naturalistic similes of rushing water, wind, and rain clouds convey a sense of naturalness to the course of life, while the similes of dream and magical enchantment convey a sense of the fleeting nature of both the things that we encounter in life and life itself. The simile of the itinerant pilgrim conveys how life, as much as we oftentimes celebrate it, is a long and tiring journey. Despite this, life is generally seen as an important moment for learning the Buddhist dharma because it represents an opportunity where one can attain spiritual enlightenment. Buddhist tantric practitioners are also instructed to practice diligently during their lifetimes in order to take advantage of this opportunity. Thus, although life is definitely not something entirely negative, it is certainly not seen as something that is particularly extraordinary.  In the same way that life is not seen as something extraordinary, death is also seen as a perfectly ordinary event the inevitably occurs over the course of time. There is a certain nonchalance in the tone of the tantras discussion of death: Death is not a failure but is simply when ""ones life is exhausted"" and when the ""elements of ones body is consumed"" (Orofino 36, 32). Death is a perfectly inevitable natural occurrence. The one occasion where death seems to be something that one should fear is when Vajrasattva describes death as something ""sudden,"" ""not forseen,"" and ""unstoppable"" (Orofino 32). The implication is that death can hit us at any time, and that we should be prepared. Nevertheless, death also represents a rare opportunity for spiritual enlightenment. According to Tantric Buddhist teachings on the intermediate states, if we are able to recognize the clear light at death, or the light found in the subsequent intermediate states as the projection of ones mind, one attains instantaneous enlightenment.  In fact, life and death are portrayed in the Tantra of the Great Secret Union of the Sun and Moon as rather similar phenomena. Both are natural occurrences over the course of time, neither is privileged over the other, both represent an opportunity to attain enlightenment, and neither are inherently sacred or special. Both life and death go hand in hand: life is an opportunity to prepare oneself for death, and death is an opportunity to attain buddhahood in an efficient way. Life and death are not polarized to the extent that they are in our culture.   Existence, Material Existence   An important polarization in the Tantra of the Great Secret Union of the Sun and Moon is the privileging of disembodied enlightened existence over material unenlightened existence. Though this type of polarization may seem unsurprising in a tradition where spiritual enlightenment and freedom are the ultimate goal, it is particularly interesting that this polarization is also reflected on a textual level: the imagery and metaphors of this text reflect this greater argument.  In the Bardo of Essential Reality, the individual receives a taste of what enlightenment could be like. In this bardo, one no longer has a physical body of flesh and blood, but a ""body of light"" that ""is free of impurities, and all visions manifest themselves in the dimension of happiness"" (Orofino, 45). The link to the physical senses is severed, and one only comes into contact with ""mental knowledge (Orofino, 45). The visions that one sees are stunning: one sees five-coloured light that appears ""beyond material limits,"" without inside or outside, and ""subtle, mobile, trembling, vibrant, quivering, scintillating"" (Orofino, 46). Furthermore, the individual is not a passive observer; she participates in the process when light from her heart joins with the light of the manifestations around her. This is described as ""the union of the state of pure Awareness with the light"" (Orofino, 47). The images of light, movement, and the intangible suggest a certain spontaneity, freedom, and joy to enlightened reality.  In contrast to this, the imagery in the Bardo of Existence is dominated by images that suggest a grimy, trapped, and painful existence. As the individual moves from the previous bardo to the Bardo of Existence, she loses the spiritual freedom and contentment of the former bardo. Instead, she feels ""provoked"" by past desires, and feels pressured into becoming ""involved"" (52). The visions that she sees suggest the gloomy din of industrial towns and cities: she sees ""temples, houses, fire, fog, rain and the sounds of groups of people"" (53). ""Damned"" to a rebirth, she sees ""desert, caves, ruins, precipices,"" all of which represent the womb (54). Thus, the womb is not seen as a fertile symbol of life, but a symbol of entrapment in the ceaseless cycle of rebirth. In a series of evocative similes, the tantra conveys the predicament that the individual finds herself in:  One feels the desire to move but feels held back by a net because one is blocked, like straw that has taken fire, or like being stuck in the mud./ One is like a bird in a trap that has been dug in the earth: in the trap of desire without control, that is transmigration. (53)  Images like the net and the bird in a trap suggest the imprisonment of the individual in the cycle of transmigration, while images like the ""mud"" and ""earth"" suggest the griminess of the samsaric condition. Finally, the simile of the ""straw that has taken fire"" suggests the visceral immediacy of the pain found in cyclic existence.  Therefore, the Tantra of the Great Secret Union of the Sun and Moon reflects the privileging of disembodied enlightened existence over material unenlightened existence even on the level of metaphor and imagery. The metaphor and imagery have the effect of acutely conveying a larger argument that privileges the freedom of enlightenment over the suffering of cyclic existence.

He loves baths, watching the mobile on his changing table and above all falling asleep while nursing.  To say he likes to be held is an under statement.  Like 10 mins here and there but most of the day he's either being held or screaming. He goes from screaming to utter contentment in under 60 seconds when picked up. I'm hoping when he can see better he'll be more interested in the toys hanging from his bouncy seat and swing and give momma a break.  He's not a big napper, 20 mins here and there but we reap the rewards at night. He typically sleeps from about 8pm until about 9 am. He will wake up to nurse twice during that time. Usually around 1:30 and 5:30.  Twice this week he's skipped the 1:30 feeding and slept straight through until 5:30. So hopefully that will be his norm soon. He likes to lay in bed in the morning and nurse while I fast forward through the Today Show ;-)  His hair still has a reddish tint and his eyes still look blue or green depending on what he is wearing. They are getting darker. I pulled pics of The Son at 2 months and his eyes were almost the same at this age.  So I expect them to turn brown in the next few weeks.  He has beautiful skin and a fabulous toothless smile.   He spits up so much more than the others. It's not enough to be of any concern but I guess our other two just didn't spit up much at all. We have been going through some laundry over here.  His favorite position is to be held is up high on your shoulder. This results in a lot of spit up down your back and someone else having to tell you it even happened.   We did come up with a name. I even called the hospital today to find out what I need to do to have it put on his birth certificate. We aren't sharing it online but I know it seemed like we were never going to decide, we finally did.  He had his 2 month check up yesterday and the poor kid received 4 shots. I was surprised The Daughter didn't cry. The Son did have to cover his eyes. They are very protective and come fuss at me to pick him up when he's crying. But when they realize  it's either their lunch or holding him they back off.   He is weighing in at 13 lbs, 3 oz (8 lbs 12 oz @ birth) and is 23.75"" long (21.5"" @ birth).  At two months The Daughter weighed 11 lbs 13 oz and was 23"" long and The Son weighed 15 lbs 13 oz and was 23.75"" long  So two months in, it's been pretty wonderful.  So good that if we weren't getting old and hadn't neutered ourselves I'd be thinking about another ;-)   Having our parents here helping for the first three weeks played a huge role in getting things off on the right foot. Not to mention a 5 yr age gap is a vacation after a 22 month one.   We made it through month two without our parents by taking our friends up on their kind offers to help. Having my kids brought home from preschool and then elementary school was a life saver. The rushing through a feeding, waking him up from one of his cat naps, etc.  I tried for two days and it was a nightmare. He'll be almost five months when we start again and they'll be at the same school on the same schedule so it will be easier.   I'm doing really well. I've recovered wonderfullly from the pregnancy and his birth. In fact I weighed myself at his appointment yesterday and I'm 1 lb. under pre-pregnancy weight. Now keep in mind I had been gaining for a year in anticipation of the pregnancy so I'm no where near my wedding weight that I vow to be back down to by his 1st birthday (or rather my 40th a month earlier).  I am juggling things well and am so thankful to report I'm having no PPD. I am savoring this because I sure paid my dues with both a horrible recovery and really bad PPD after my 2nd was born. So three at 7 yrs, 5 yrs and 2 months is a walk in the park compared to my experience with two at 2 yrs and 2 months.    The next month will be really interesting since I have all three home :-) We're all enjoying getting to know him and just love him so much.   "

In Japanese folklore, Hotei-san is one of the Seven Lucky Gods (Shichifukujin.) In China, legend has it that he was an eccentric Chan (Zen) monk who lived in the early 10th C. Some Buddhist traditions consider him an incarnation of the Maitrea (Future) Buddha. In Vietnam, he is known as Bo Dai. His name translates as Cloth Bag, which he is usually seen carrying, along with Buddhist prayer beads. There have been several influences to George Gledhills ceramic work. Buddhism has been a guiding force in life for many years, and George even visits local prisons to teach the Dharma to inmates. Through pottery and Buddhism, he was exposed to Tea practitioners who complimented his work and encouraged him to produce Tea wares. Their introduction to the world of Tea Ceremony has helped to shape much of his recent work. In the past, George served in the Peace Corps in Bolivia, working with local potters and using only materials available locally. They dug all of the clay, made the bricks, built the kilns, and formulated glazes from whatever materials they could find. The only firing fuel was wood. This experience led to a great respect for the results of working with unprocessed materials, and especially for the magical qualities of wood firing a primitive kiln. Many of George's pots are fired in a noborigama (climbing kiln) built by George in 2012, on his farm in Payette, Idaho. The kiln has been named Shozangama (Pine Mountain Kiln.)They are created using mainly raw materials available in the Pacific Northwest. The whole process is marked by a great deal of physical labor, but this is the only way to get the results he desires. "

I recognize that you were given no choice in this event.  You are making no vow tonight nor should you be. Instead, I wish to affirm the bond I have with you. The strongest rope is woven from many strands. My bond with you is the countless precious memories we have together. Your first word, your first step,  sweet baby breath whispering a secret, the tight hug that says I love you. Even the dirty diapers are precious memories. I carry those memories,  that bond,  in my heart forever and so into this new chapter of my life. As we marry, both of us acknowledge that the bond we have with our children individually is one of the things we love about each other.  You shall be loved every moment of your life, every moment I draw breath. It is my deepest hope that you will find the love in this new marriage extends and enfolds you.  I desire for you to find in this marriage affection from a friend you did not know youd have and contentment in a family circle that, while atraditional perhaps, remains intent on providing all of us with the tenderness and fulfillment that only close family ties can bring, stable and strong.    As your life moves from this day onward, growing, shifting and changing as you do, I hope you will always have the blessed certainty of knowing  that your place cannot be changed by anything we do here today. You belong. It is my fervent prayer as you grow and negotiate the terrain of your life that you will find our relationship continues to be the safe harbor and refuge it always has been.  Our individual histories do not disappear nor get swept aside simply because one of your parents fell in love.   And now we both, Sheri and Joe, vow to you to continue to see the history of the individual relationships we have with you and to give those relationships and that history respect, tenderness and space to grow. In our desire to see one another happy and fulfilled, we could not honor our promises here if we did not see your place in each others heart and give it our heartfelt blessing, for one another and most of all, for you.  Thank you for being here tonight to share in our joy. Thank you for loving us enough to be happy for our happiness. You have been loved from the moment you drew breath; you will be loved until the day we are gone and into the world after this. That never, ever can change.  Love, Sheri and Joe "

Not only in the big global hitler n stalin picture, but also on the smallest personal level.  Even in my own life, I can see exactly where my episodes of unhappiness have brought suffering or distress or (at the very least) inconvenience to those around me.  The search for contentment is, therefore, not merely a self-preserving and self benefiting act, but also a generous gift to the world.  Clearing out all your misery gets you out  of the way.  You cease being an obstacle, not only to yourself but to anyone else.  Only then are you free to serve and enjoy other people.

First of all, I want to thank everyone who has supported me, I truly appreciate your kind words, your help, faves and views. I know that it takes precious time out of your day to do so. I've come to know so many wonderful people here on Flickr, you inspire me daily to be a better photographer and a better person. And by just being here, you brighten my days and weeks. Truly. I am grateful for the many groups that I belong to that provided inspiration along the way. Me Again Monday has been huge this year for inspiration and support! Thank you Patty and everyone.  Personally, this last year has been the best one of my life so far. It's been a year of growing, learning, and putting my feelings about things and thoughts into action. This year has been overflowing with fun and adventure. Laughter and joy managed to find its way into every one of my days. Some days more than others, but there was always a bright spot. It's been a year of deep appreciation, contentment and love, such that I'd never experienced before. I look forward to more of the same this next year.  I won't be starting up with another 52-week project right now. I am currently doing a 366-project, all self-portraits, all on my iPhone. I am certain that I will continue to post selfies as well as my other photography with my ""real"" camera. It you notice that I haven't posted in a while, I'd appreciate a nudge!  xo "

Anthropy is thus every action of Man while on Earth  between fellow men and between men and the Planet. It is the relationship of all these actions with the vision of the Universe in which Man and Planet are found.  Entropy is the variation of energy in a system during any transformation  it is the same as the quantity of energy that the system exchanges with the environment. The first law of Entropy does not limit the possibilities of transforming one energy into another. This first principle establishes that energy cannot be created nor destroyed.  Garden is a word derived from Hebrew, comprising the prefix gan, which means protect or defend, implying a notion of enclosure or privacy, and the expression oden or eden, which transmits a sensation of pleasure or contentment.  The etymological interpretation of this word is reflected in the concept of privacy of land for leisure or contentment.  Gardens are an aesthetic expression of human ideas and a concrete expression of mans relationship with nature.  The forest represent the total phenomenon, it is nature in its greatest manifestation. The forest lays a role rich in meanings, which makes it a place of beginnings."

First, I am very pleased with the way the image turned out.  I tried hard to have the branch arching over her and to get the depth of focus appropriate.  The second reason is because we lost Zephyr in October, so I am obviously treasuring every photo I took of her this year, as well as previously.  Her Favorite Things - May version is spring.  Zephyr loves spring, probably more than she ever did before.  Although she loves snow and cold, it has become difficult for her to get around in the snow, especially when it is deep.  By March, her world had become fairly restricted to the plowed areas close to the house.  Now that spring is finally here, she is enjoying the entire yard again, and she is happy.  It has been really good to see a bounce back in her step, even if those steps are slow, and it is heartwarming to see her looking so contented and happy.  The things Zephyr loves about spring - she loves having us outside with her more, and she loves that we are more relaxed in summer and spend more time playing with her.  She loves to help me garden - if I am kneeling on the ground working on the flower beds, she will sneak up behind me, stick her nose in my ear and plant a kiss on my cheek.  She will then plop down beside me and watch carefully for an opportunity to steal my gloves. She loves to be outdoors, and she loves the sights and sounds of spring, she spends hours in this pose, just watching and listening and enjoying the world.  She luxuriates in the grass - she lays in it, rolls in it, stretches out on her side and presses as much of herself against it as possible.  She lays under the spruce trees that drop their sticky bud sacks on her (as you can see in the photo, she is messy with them).  She loves the cool evenings and mornings, in fact she is spending all night outdoors right now, asking to come inside only when she thinks it is time for breakfast (usually about an hour before it really is time).  This is also a good time of year to steal our shoes from the garage and strew them around the yard.  Spring is good, and Zephyr is contented. "

Budai(in Chinese) is often depicted as having the appearance of an amply proportioned bald man wearing a robe and wearing or otherwise carrying prayer beads. He carries his few possessions in a cloth sack, being poor but content.  His figure appears throughout Chinese culture as a representation of contentment. His image graces many temples, restaurants, amulets, and businesses. I remember having one at our home long back for the same reason :)  Amongst Westerners new to Buddhism, Budai is often confused with the historical Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama. However, the two are visually very distinct. Gautama is commonly depicted as being tall and slender in appearance (although since no images of him from his lifetime exist, this depiction of him is unverifiable and possibly idealized); Budai is short and overweight. (Buddha means one who has achieved a state of perfect enlightenment and there are several people who have been given the title.)   Source: # Wiki  BIGGER LUCK HERE!"

Of course, these features are not unique to this exact spot, so it's hard to say that the temples found themselves here just because the landscape had some inherently attractive or spiritual properties.  Anyway, I don't know enough about Hinduism to have any idea what kind of places ""have sacred written all over them"" (in Doug's phrase), or even how these places look and feel to Hindu eyes.  I can only bring my own, Western-shaped picturesque sensibility, which tells me this whole place is drop-dead gorgeous.  That runs the risk, though, of reducing the temples to charming follies scattered in the landscape for solely aesthetic effects, which, of course, is to take them totally out of their actual context.  I don't know.  I felt tremendous peace and contentment wandering around these places; I can't say that it was a spiritual experience, but I'm very glad I went and I recommend it to anybody else who's even within striking distance of Hampi."

July 3, 2010  My backpacking trips aren't always filled with beautiful views, babbling brooks, and relaxing waterfalls. At times, they can be hot, sticky, itchy, and completely unforgiving. But of all the places I've hiked so far, the most uncomfortable have been close to home: Southern Indiana in the summer.  I can hear fireworks, but only see the flash of fireflies. Bangs and pops, but no whistles or screeches. High-pitched sounds dont travel as far. And with the banning of fireworks within the boundaries of the Hoosier National Forest, the night is mostly silent.  Its July 3rd. Im hiking alone overnight on the sixteen-mile Two Lakes Loop Trail. As usual for this time of year, when the sun finally sets the pyromaniacs cant wait any longer to light their fuses, and blow shit up to prove their love for America.  The temperature is finally starting to drop from low-90s to tolerable. Both sweat and humidity test the old adage that teamwork can divide the work and multiply success, by easily sticking my sleeping bag to my skin.  I put my book down and climb out of my hammock tent to brush my teeth before I fall asleep. My headlamp reveals a blue-tinted forest around me and illuminates the toothbrush and toothpaste in my backpack. Moths fly dumbly toward the light on my forehead. Dozens of them stick to my sweaty face and neck, beating their delicate wings in a confused frenzy. I swat at them pointlessly, like a much less scary parody of Hitchcocks, ""The Birds"".  I turn off my light, so I can brush in peace. I stand barefoot and add the acoustics of teeth brushing to the nocturnal sounds of the forest. The moonlit surface of Indian Lake shimmers between the silhouettes of trees.  Bang, bang, pop. More fireworks.  Somewhere on the lake, a fisherman is floating in a boat. He occasionally scans the lake with his spotlight between short nicotine and tar coughing fits. I briefly wonder what he would think if he saw me in the woods. I could stand by the shore with an emotionless blank stare. His own monochromatic blue light would illuminate me for a moment as it passes by, then I'd quickly duck into the shadows. Hed look back, certain he saw someone standing there, but never really certain of what he saw. I could give him a story to tell. In my opinion, that is the best gift of all.  Instead I retreat to my hammock. I really have no desire to stay outside its protective mesh and get even more blood mugged by mosquitoes. Right before nightfall I started a fire that is now ash and embers, to help keep them at bay, but near the lake Im sure they are in swarms. A couple hundred are already flying around the forest, bellies engorged with my blood; my DNA buzzing above me like Mike Teavee in Willie Wonkas Chocolate Factory.  With the mosquitoes, cicadas are also out, repeating the same relaxing mantra over and over like druids. It's relaxing, but ugh, what I would give for a cool breeze. The only breeze Ive had tonight was from the flutter of moth wings in my face.  Fireflies are landing on the tent mesh giving me an opportunity to really study them up close from underneath. Even with a bit of knowledge on bioluminescence, their random flashing still seems like magic. At least I think its random.  Maybe they are trying to communicate with me. A message of great importance repeated over and over, every summer of my life. Ryan, you are the chosen one, you must stop the reactor. You're the planets only hope. The distressing part is, I'll probably never know for sure.  The trail is only sixteen miles long, but I am intrigued by the intersecting American Discovery Trail, the coast-to-coast pathway connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. I may detour back onto it for a short while, just to say I  Ok wait, that was a flash, pause, flash, flash, flash, pause, flash, flash. If there is a firefly Morse code, Ill figure it out.  Anyway, I might take a detour on the ADT. It seems fitting for Independence Day to be on a trail that spans the whole country. One of these days Im going to get on it and not stop until I leap into the Pacific.  Two flashes, pause, then five.  I should note that Im roughing it with Pinot Noir in a flask, probably why Im writing all this. See, Im not insane, as you may be thinking, but nor am I drunk. Just a little wine happy.  Ooh seven consecutive flashes. Wait, 1, 3, 2, 2, 5, and 7? Those are all prime numbers. Interesting. Cant be a coincidence.  Yep. All alone in a hammock, in the woods. Sipping Pinot Noir from a metal flask with sophistication and class. It would be impossible to sip it any other way.  Hmm, maybe the fireflies are trying to give me GPS coordinates. I should keep writing the numbers down and see where they lead me. Its a good a reason to travel somewhere as any, right? It would be spontaneous. An adventure. Maybe Ill find that reactor, or something.  There are a LOT of bug bites polka-dotting my arms and legs. Maybe anemia is the root of my peculiar thoughts tonight. They havent started itching yet, but histamines are on their way to set off an inflammatory immune reaction that will irritate nerve endings all over my body causing me to itch uncontrollably. I cant wait.  Regardless of the bugs, bites, and humidity, somehow the trip has still been worth it. My time spent in the hammock listening to cicadas has been nice.  My backpacking trips aren't always filled with beautiful views, babbling brooks, and relaxing waterfalls. At times, they can be hot, sticky, itchy, and completely unforgiving but I love it. No matter where or when I walk into the woods, I rarely fail to find a silence, solitude, and contentment that nothing else provides.  (By the way, I put my recordings of the firefly flashes into Google Earth as GPS coordinates. They took me to an isolated dirt road near Turrah, Sudan. Screw that! Sorry Fireflies, you chose the wrong messiah.)"

(Buddha - Hindu Prince Gautama Siddharta, the founder of Buddhism, 563-483 B.C.)  This is a view of the city of Gwalior located in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, it was shot from the Small Sas Bahu temple built in red sandstone during the 10th century and dedicated to Lord Vishnu.  According to local tradition, Gwalior owes its name to a sage of former times.  Suraj Sen, a prince of the Kachhwaha clan of the eighth century, is said to have lost his way in the jungle. On a secluded hill he met an old man, the sage Gwalipa, whose influence almost took him by surprise.  Upon asking the sage for some drinking water he was led to a pond; the waters not only quenched his thirst but cured him of leprosy. Out of gratefulness, the prince wished to offer the sage something in return, and the sage asked him to build a wall on the hill in order to protect the other sages from wild animals which often disturbed their yagnas (or pujas).  Suraj Sen later built a palace inside the fort, which had been named ""Gwalior"" after the sage who had given him the gift of a new life; the city which grew around the fort took the same name. The city became, over the centuries, the cradle of great dynasties and with each, the city gained new dimensions from the warrior-kings, poets, musicians and saints who contributed to making it a capital renowned throughout the country.

Then I would ask for peaceful rest,  To visit you at night;  And that your every morning,  Dawn shimmering and bright.  I would ask for nothing,  To give back to myself;  As long as you are happy,  I want for nothing else.

As I did last week (and quite possibly the week before), I put it off until the very last day (my week ends on Mondays, happy coincidence for the MAM group!). I ran out at lunch time from work today, found a wall that I could use for some negative space and took some shots during a mild misting of rain.   First week of my birthday month is over and it's been a great one! A really wonderful one. For those that commented under a previous post where I mentioned celebrating my birthday month, this is the first time that I've ever made a conscious effort to do so. A friend of mine celebrates her birthday month every year and when I met her I thought it was such a great idea. However, as every year rolled around, despite my good intentions there's been no celebrating until the actual day. Which is still a great thing. Don't get me wrong. If you think about it, life is too short not to have fun and celebrate. Celebrate everything. Every little thing.   Try putting some space between the ""no,"" ""can't,"" and ""shouldn't"" words...

He is almost always shown smiling or laughing, hence his nickname in Chinese, the Laughing Buddha. Hotei is happy because he is well-fed (indicated by his great girth), wealthy and can afford to be generous. He brings happiness to others through his appearance and rubbing his belly is supposed to bring luck. The title ""Buddha"" does not directly refer to the founder of Buddhism but indicates that the figure has a benevolent nature and is known for good works.  Hotei is theorized to have begun as a real Buddhist monk in China over 1,000 years ago named Pu-Tai. He was considered a man of good and loving character and, therefore, an incarnation of the bodhisattva. However, his large belly sets him apart from other ascetics. The Chinese legend is seen as being melded into the Shinto god of luck Hotei when Buddhist monks migrated to Japan to spread their religion. This figure then became common figure for both Japan and China as a deliverer of good luck, contentment, and prosperity."

Sort of like...taking Manhattan west of the East River and just moving it to Jamacia Beach :)   Which I suppose makes sense after Chicago was entirely rebuilt after the fire. In 1921 I guess. Or was it 1912. So much for cities that are thousands of years old ;)  Is Rome better now than it was before Nero fiddled? LOL I guess for Christians, certainly...  Well, after giving up on using my BB9550 as a modem with my TMobile account I settled for one of their ""Rocket 3.0""4G USB modem adapters for my laptop (I know, ""ancient tech"" by todays' standards and not even USB3.0) and I'm using it now (""...oh, no!!!"") and it seems to work pretty well, really, even on a 3G connection with one bar. Runs rings around my old Sprint adapter which I had this time last year and just sucked, really. I'd say that it's almost as fast if not ""snapper"" than my Comcast cable-modem connection. Though it's rated at 48kb/sec (""bits not bytes? arrgh!"")  and my Comcast connection was up to 2Mbits/sec and that was 2 years ago. Probably more in the meantime. It just made no sense to pay $70+ for a home cable connection that ONLY WORKED AT HOME, no matter how fast it was...especially if Comcast wouldn't let you use it for a ""server"". I.E. no real uploads and no real sustained download (though they seem to have realized that video is usually ""sustained""). Serious hair-splitting for ""unlimited internet"".   I have no idea what the rate is for this thing.  I just know it's supposedly-unlimited, decently-fast, and works well away from home. Though I had to fire it up a couple of times before it really got in gear, and I've yet to get it to work (haven't tried) with my Linux laptop while my Sprint adapter worked just fine with it. So, if the cost is acceptable (my phone alone is $50/month) that's one problem down. The next is having to lug this old 15"" laptop around with me...or spending $300+ on some form of iPad. And I really, really need to get one, it's become almost a must-have item.  But what do you expect when the average ""portable computing device"" is now limited to 1GB of ram, a 1GHz processor and a 10"" display with embedded graphics now simply because that is all that just about every Internet-related app really needs...especially behind a 4G line...and just about every app that anyone really needs now is tied to the Internet?   ...who cares if I want to do ""real work"" far, far away from my desk or home office? Well, I do. I want to ride out somewhere an hour out of town, find a park or a library, sit down somewhere peaceful with the sun shining and nice weather and just sit there and work. Who wants to stare at the same damm 4 walls every day, in the same part of town? That's not ""creativity"" that's bureaucracy. That's what people do whose role is to be in a certain place over a certain time.   Well I would like to be in ""a certain place over a certain time"" mentally not just physically. And that place is not ""in an office downtown"" and that time is not 9-5 every day. Or actually 9-9 as the case may be. Or not be. But usually is. For me ""work"" usually means that I'm there early and getting-off late and why would I want to do that in the same place each and every day? I spend 80% of my life either at work or commuting. That's time that can never be replaced. If I must work, I would prefer to work with at least some pleasant variety in terms of scenery, surroundings. Is that not why we got into photography, so we don't have to look at the same dreary things every day? I think so.  So, increased ""mobility"" makes us better photographers simply because we aren't in the same place all the time. And a certain minimum level of connectivity is required so that we can remain productive, ""gainfully-employed"", while we're on the road. Unless we want to be factory-workers in China, or sling burgers at McDonalds. Those of us who need high-performance computing have been separated into two groups: those who need a high-performance *personal computer* and those who need high-performance *video*. There are many ways to get the latter. It is no longer required to have a powerful GPU with fast memory running on an SLI rig. An easy way to get it is simply to write better software and design video apps that have a high ""Image-content""/datarate ratio.   Just like with photography. ""More pixels + bigger sensors + bigger lenses"" does not always equal ""better images"". Sometimes it's worse. For endemic reasons. If anything the key to better images is simply to get out and see more. Often the key to a better *life* is simply to get out and see more. Though of course like better gear, this can be overdone.  But can one be content with ""good enough""?  I do not ask about ""true contentedness"". How about just ""happy""?  Can we *really* be happy in such a condition, or are we just fooling ourselves, reduced to an intellectual argument that is forced to reach that conclusion by our ""maturity"" and ""rational nature""?   What if we are forced to be unhappy with life simply because intellectually we rationalize ""happiness"" where it doesn't exist, we ""rationally"" confine ourselves to this state of existence (or perhaps we're simply forced to try to be happy and rational in a rationally-unhappy state of existence simply by the facts of our existence and available options out of our current state of existence), and, quite possibly, our subconscious, our ""emotional side"" rebels in many ways?   Well certainly with enough experience we will know when we are truly happy and not just at the end of a rational road which ""logically"" equates to ""contentment"".  Well, now I have an idea how fast this Rocket 3.0 is. I'm viewing a TV show online and downloading it using DownItAll, and the average is 275kB/sec sustained with peaks in the 400kB/sec range. On a 3G connection. At 7:30pm on a Saturday night.   Oh, look: and it's even plug & play in Ubuntu. How nice. Though there's no connection-management utility...just the Ubuntu networking interface and the light is blue on my Rocket vs green which I guess means a 4G connection...anyway it's fast. Quite fast. More than ""comfortably-fast"".  Anyway all I know is that there is a fine line between finding happiness through logical, ""reasonable"" activity and finding it through irrational unreasonable activity that, fundamentally, deep down inside, makes us really, truly happy. Think of ""schadenfreude"", at the very least. And what happens when we make ourselves happy by convincing ourselves that unreason is reason, that irrationality is rationality...that illogic is logic? Of course that is an irrational thing to do...right? But obviously it could work anyway. Given the right circumstances.  So. We have proven, logically, that success is not necessarily the product of rational thought, attitudes, ""behaviors"". Often it is the product of irrational ones carried out in atmospheres that are conducive to their success despite their irrationality. I wonder what we could prove if we simply abandon concern with logic and reason, altogether and we had the power to force others to at least try to make us happy with our conclusions. Need I preface the nouns ""logic"" and ""reason"" with ""true""? Really what fucking difference would that make? ""Truth"" is in the eye of the beholder. Reality is in the mind of the observer.   ""Logic"" and ""reason"" are whatever anyone wants to think that they are. You have your opinion, I have mine: what physical law is there that says that I must agree with you? There are none other than the ""laws"" that exist in your own head. My version of ""logic"" says that nothing can be true, as an opinion, unless someone actually holds it; and as such it is obvious that there are multiple opinions on the same topic, just as there are multiple people. Truly their opinions can be expected to vary over time. To think that there is only one opinion on *any* topic is ludicrous. At least in *my* mind.   Of course, there is no law that says that you must agree with me ;)  So, in our ""democratic"" society we end up with ""logic"" that is logical because most people believe it to be ""logical"". But what sense does it make to define Reality based on popular opinion? When we say that the world makes ""progress"", in what way do we mean this? Well quite often it is ""progress"" *away* from current popular opinion. As more and more people find things to be undeniably true because they are shown to be undeniably-true, to them, on a regular basis. Eventually even the biggest Luddite out there believes that they are true.   But what do we do in the meantime? "

contentment,http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2915/14260886083_889068080d_z.jpg,1,4,"Bock FInal Series For my final series I simply wanted to create a set of visually appealing photos. In doing this I wanted to explore the extreme contentness one feels when looking at something organized and appealing. Personally, I really enjoy seeing things that are organized, yet random, where the organization and color are the only things that relate the objects. I wanted to incorporate this into my series to show that even though the objects are completely different from each other, they can still come together to form something visually appealing.   Each photo is organized by color, and the colors are yellow, blue, red, green, and orange. Some of them turned out better than the others, but they all give off the feeling of precision, contentment, and organization. They all are appealing individually and still look nice together as a group. Even though they are all completely different objects, they still relate to each other because of their color and the way they are organized. I believe the yellow picture demonstrates my concept the most clearly because of the variety in shades of yellow as well as the variety of objects that come together and make it visually appealing to the viewer. Even though other colors are present, the image still goes together and creates the content feeling. I also think the blue image does a nice job of showing this in that the objects are very random, ranging from a sock, to a candle, to a whale cookie cutter, yet they still all come together and create something that is appealing to the viewer. The images as a whole really go together nicely, even though each one involves a different color. I tried to keep some parts of the images similar, and this involved using some of the same objects in different colors. This helped even more to tie in the aspect of all the images relating to each other."

He died when I was at school, but my mother was home. She stroked his head and sang to him about his favourite food, yoghurt!  Elvis was 2 years and 10 months old. This photo was taken when he was a baby! He was so cute and round.  Some memories: - the first time I took him to the vet, he shrieked when the vet picked him up - at that first visit, the vet told me he was ""quite overweight"" - when he was younger, he was comfortable being carried, but he got cranky as he grew older, and bit me fiercely each time I tried to carry him :( - he loved food! some of his favourite treats - milk, yoghurt, green veggies, fruit - the very first time I gave him a little bowl of milk to drink, he drank continuously before he had enough. when I picked him up, he had such a look of contentment on his face! true and utter bliss. that's when I knew he loved milk. but he developed skin allergy from milk, according to the vet, so I stopped giving him milk but gave yoghurt instead. - in his last weeks, I indulged him and let him try cheese, peanut butter and a bit of coconut meat. all of which he enjoyed - in his younger days, he was spider hammy and would climb all over his cage and walk across the ceiling bars - once when I opened the cage door to feed him, he jumped out in excitement and landed in my glass of juice! I had a moment's fright before I quickly picked him up and towel-dried him. he doggy paddled for a few seconds he was in the glass. - everytime he had something yummy to eat, or was feeling relaxed in general he would stretch out on his wheel for a siesta :) - he died in his food bowl, the first hammie i've had to do so. the rest passed on in their sandbox."

Sweat and tears are made as time passes by, but at the end of the day, as we return home to our families a smile is made right at the moment our front door opens, bringing a refreshing zest that could fuel us to go on and face the following day with confidence. In every reunion that we have, generous amount of stories paired with laughter strengthens the unique bond that we share.  What a great way to begin the week!  I hope you guys had a pleasant Sunday!

The hills are not very large, but what they lackin size is made up in number. There is a scraggy cedar on the side of a bluff, grow-ing among large slabs of blue flint, and here are clumpsof wild currant and gooseberry bushes, whose leavesare already yellowing. Bunches of prickly-pear weregrowing on rocky places where even the buffalo-grasscould not take root. There was the pond, situated on a draw. It islarge enough to be called a lake, though of course it isonly a pond in Kansas. The waves, in never-endingsuccession, beat against the mossy rock-work of the damwith a hollow, mournful sound.

John Donne   A letter is a blessing, a great and all-too-rare privilege that can turn a private moment into an exalted experience.

A little over a year in the making, Long Lost Ghosts is the album Emily Hurds fans have been waiting for, featuring her signature voice and folk-pop songs that tell stories of old-fashioned love and its bittersweet triumph. Highlights include the irresistible blues-tinged hit, ""Irreparably Yours"" and the palpable nostalgia of the cross-country driving tune ""Long Lost Ghosts."" Emily's fervent crooning uplifts in ""My Favorite Part,"" ""Silent Conversations,"" and ""I Won't Tell a Soul.""  For the first time in a long time, she trades in her regular heartbreaker imagery for a welcome dose of contentment in ""Brand New,"" ""Skipping Stones,"" and ""Easy Call.""  The songsmith sings it like she feels it.  Over the course of her eight full-length studio albums, Emily's singer-songwriter stylings have effortlessly fused pure vocals and chillingly sparse music with chamber pop, indie soul, and gypsy jazz.  On Long Lost Ghosts, she does what she does best: combining acoustic instruments and vivid nature metaphorssinging of winter wheat, crickets, gravel roads, and skylarksto connect with her audience.    The lilt in her voice is as endearing as ever, and the support of her backing band enhances without distracting from the delicate and hopeful vibe that has come to define Emily Hurds music.  Lush vocals, vibrant acoustic production, and tones of defiant optimism run through all the songs on Long Lost Ghosts, echoing the uptempo balladry and intelligent anthems, often linked to kindred troubadours Lyle Lovett and Steve Earle.  Emily wrote the songs on her ukulele and recorded them on the vintage grand piano at Chicagos King Size Sound Labs.  The record features an all-star line-up of Chicago musicians: John Abbey (Robbie Fulks, Amy Speace), Darren Garvey (Cameron McGill and What Army, Miles Nielsen), Sue Demel (Sons of the Never Wrong, Come Sunday), and Maria McCullough (Sleepy Lou, Jonas Friddle).    Emily Hurd is an inspirational national indie act, performing for growing pockets of loyal followers who revel in her ample cache of new and old original songs.  She's shared the stage and/or opened for Irma Thomas, Bettye Lavette, Roger McGuinn, and Ozomatli. Her music is featured on the popular CBS crime drama NCIS.  She plays live on WGN TV and radio, WXRT radio, amongst other acclaimed Chicago music institutions.  She appears on the prestigious Old Town School of Folk Music ""Songbook"" collection (released by Bloodshot Records).  She is a winner/finalist in the John Lennon Songwriting Contest, NPR's NewSong Contest, and The International Songwriting Competition.   Her supporters in the Southeast run the annual Emilyfest in an open barn down in a holler of rural North Carolina.  The big skies and high country grass at Emilyfest serve as the perfect backdrop for her fans to listen and lose themselves for a while in her inimitable lyrics. Just listen... "

Biting at the heels of contentment, Energy made manifest, seems like matter has betrayed universal law  Im not really sure what that means.  Probably nothing of consequence. Generations lamentations, devastations, spasmodic earth ever changing, rearranging, decks of cards not in order.  Chaotic scrimmages fighting against an invisible enemy steadily marching forward, never looking back.  Steady streams of malcontent effortlessly winding down the forlorn path.  Writhing under the pressure of time, withering bloody corpses of yesterday, today, tomorrow.  Existence as we know it ceases without warning, followed by evolutions, revolutions, new species doomed to repeat our past.  "

Sloan Wilson  Each blade of grass has its spot on earth whence it draws its life, its strength; and so is man rooted to the land from which he draws his faith together with his life.
