Wrath (Latin, ira), also known as ""rage"", may be described as inordinate and uncontrolled feelings of hatred and anger. Wrath, in its purest form, presents with self-destructiveness, violence, and hate [...] Dante described vengeance as ""love of justice perverted to revenge and spite"". In its original form, the sin of anger also encompassed anger pointed internally rather than externally. Thus suicide was deemed as the ultimate, albeit tragic, expression of hatred directed inwardly. Patience (Latin, Patientia) Forbearance and endurance through moderation. Resolving conflicts and injustice peacefully, as opposed to resorting to violence. Accepting the grace to forgive [...] Creating a sense of peaceful stability and community rather than suffering, hostility, and antagonism.  (from Wikipedia: Sins, Virtues)  (tl;dr -- this stuff absolutely fascinates me.)  i had the idea for this shot before even reading that bit about suicide; i think it correlates nicely, because the photo shows an element of self-destruction in itself. Wrath is caught up in her own hate and desire to cause violence, but Patience still reaches out, unwilling to strike back, even to defend herself.   (i may or not make a series of the rest of the sins/virtues.) "

This is not the end, but the beginning of a new phase of revolt.  Students, their parents and many workers will feel a deeper anger now.  A cabinet of 18 millionaires has wrecked the future of millions of young people. It wants to move on to do the same for those who rely on Education Maintenance Allowance. A policy based on lies, which the Lib Dems pledged not to introduce, was pushed through in the shadow of mounted police charging students.

We walked marched there giving the message to the peasants, while many of them showed their support to the struggle.  During the march the participants showed their energy, force and anger that drives us all to campaign for animals and advocates animal rights, sending the message of the freedom animals must have, without being property of anyone and with the goal of reaching a status of respect for all species in our planet.  After almost an hour marching, we arrived at the Universidad Catlica, place where speeches were given and a candlelit vigil in the entrance of the faculty where the monkeys are kept.

Bullfighting is very long traditional event in Spain but people like me from outside of Spain might think it's brutal. For me it's more like documenting what I saw not I liked it so much. I think it should be forbidden.  From a technical point of view it has three parts called tercios or suertes: sticks, barbed darts and finally the matadors stick with a red flag attached to it. The president of the fight, which includes six fights lasting 20 minutes each.  When the bull enters and during the first part, the matador in his traditional costume raises the red and gold flag. He makes sweeping motions with the cape and helpers both on foot and on horseback drive their lances into the bull, gauging the liveliness and characteristics of their opponent.  During the second part of the fight three pairs of darts are driven into the bulls neck. In the final and the most distressing part of the fight the bullfighter becomes a killer.   This is the most dangerous part where he attracts the injured animal towards him. At the last moment he must kill the beast with a single thrust of his sword.  ""For one week a year, thousands of locals and tourists gather, and pay to witness the a ritual which is advertised as glorious and entertaining (for the benefit of pompously dressed up males with questionable skills in avoiding collision with a big animal) but is in fact nothing short of gorry, gruesome and truly sad. Old and sick bulls are chosen to be killed in those rituals, and they are being weakened for weeks before the ""fight"".  They put laxatives in their food and heavy sandbags on their backs. They are often beaten. They file their horns down to the tender quick and they drug them. Prior to the Running, electric prods and sharp sticks are used to rile the bulls in a frenzy. Petroleum jelly is put in their eyes to blind them. Wet newspaper is stuffed in their ears and their vocal cords are cut to prevent the audience to hear their cries. Lances are driven into the bulls' neck muscles so they can't lift their heads. By the time the matador appears the bulls are weak from blood loss and disoriented from being chased in circles.  When the ""fight"" finally begins, the bull is already on the verge of collapsing, held only by his last instinct of survival. All dignity is stripped down from him and he is confused, desperate and suffering. Then, in the ring, the toreador slaughters the bull by stabbing the bull repeatedly in the spine. The bull's death is slow and not just ugly, it's petrifying and maddening. Often he wears long blankets to hide their entrails, which spill out when they are gorged and disemboweled."""

He is a sexist old man who continuously takes out his anger on mefor reasons unknown. In the last week before the break he returned our exams and I realised that he had given me a grade worse than what I had produced and would have deserved. Most of the ""mistakes"" I had made where made up and when I asked him about it he suddenly invented new rules on when to use what, simply to accomodate his grading and taking off points from me. It was all made-up bullshit and I was so upset and told him off which resulted in him yelling like a mad cow.   From the look in his eyes I frankly believe that he would have just smacked me in the face hadn't it been for my whole course watching us.   Naturally, that day was the final straw in this already complicated teacher-student relationship and I went home with an upset stomach from being so angry.   That emotion, together with this weird song I found on youtube, inspired me to take this image to let it all out and get over it...  Which worked surprisingly well :)   Here is the song/MV for reference:  youtu.be/gsSSB6lQxGU  If you add to favourites, please leave a comment  Also, follow me on tumblr or instagram"

The colonel,unmindful of the pallid countenance and significant glances of theburning eye, leaned back in his chair, with arms akimbo, regard-ing the young farmer with cool disdain. A murmur of surpriseand indignation arose from the congregated guests. Dicks faceturned red as a turkey-gobblers. He deliberately took the pigby the hind legs, and with a sudden whirl brought it down uponthe head of the unlucky officer. Stunned by the squashing blow,astounded and blinded with steams of gTavy and wads of stuffing,he attempted to rise, but blow after blow from the fat pig fellupon his bewildered head. He seized a carving-knife, and attempt-ed to defend himself with blind but ineffectual fury, and at length,with a desperate effort, rose and took to his heels.

I chose to do a series of images on the Seven Deadly Sins as I have always been interested in vices and virtues of the human race.  I decided that I wanted to portray each sin in a non-clich way yet still related to each sin.  For Wrath I really wanted to emote anger that wrath is and I told the male model to keep screaming at me as loud as he could until he couldn't scream any longer. I shot this in the middle of a field where noone else was around, so I was able to get the full passion and emotion in his face. I used a very wide aperture of f/3.5 to create a shallow depth of field so that only the face was in focus. I created a simple edit of turning the image into black and white then overlaying red over the top, burning the eyes so that they are a lot darker and turning them red. The reason I chose to use red was because the colour theory emotes passion and anger, everything that I wanted to portray with this image. "

So I got my hammer. Bye bye modem.  I called my ISP on Thursday night and spoke to a very nice lady. She couldn't understand me, I couldn't understand her. I spent a good fifteen minutes bellowing the phrase 'NO THAT IS NOT MY POSTCODE' down the phone at her.  My new modem will apparently be delivered to work today. If it gets here it will be a fucking miracle."
