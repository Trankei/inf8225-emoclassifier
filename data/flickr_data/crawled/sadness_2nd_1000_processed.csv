And I'm actually crying in this photo.  Made to feel small, and insignificant. Left out, left behind. No choice. I wasn't worth changing for. I wasn't worth being a better person for. Then what the fuck am I worth?   It's really difficult to look at this. Let alone share it. "

I've learned to live by myself: i've learned how to cook, to clean the house, to share the house with other students, to manage my money better, to have healthy life style, to eat better, to have discipline and responsibilities. I've learned to appreciate all i have, even if it's less than the others. I've learned to appreciate my parents and all the things they did and do to make me have a better life. Because i confess i was too spoiled years ago and i remember saying that all i wanted before was to leave home. Now i know that nothing's better than being at mom and dad's house, i love them. I've learned to appreciate, as well, all the things they paid for me:  this year were the driving licence, a new pair of glasses and the university course. Because we aren't financially so good these past years, so i'm really grateful for those gifts.  Also, there were days with pure happiness and others with intense sadness and i've come to learn how to deal with my emotions. Now, i know myself better and also how to manage stress better.  This year i've travelled a lot (only to Rome, though), and i've learned new cultures, mentalties and speccially i've figured out what was to share my life with someone i loved. We absolutelly were a great team, and i ended returning back to Portugal with tons of expectations - like i decided to keep fighting for this love, this long distance relationship till i could end my pysiotheraphy course. We were together for 5 years so i put a lot of effort to continue for more 4 years till we could be together for real, like fairytales - ""and they lived happily ever after"". Though this love story hadn't a very good ending, i still believe in true love and  i also believe that my prince is still out there. The thing is that i've never been so disappointed like now and i've never fallen so hard before. But at some point, it isn't that bad, right?... i'm getting up again and i believe i can become stronger and wiser.  2010  was a very exhausting year but hell yeah, very productive! I think i'm pretty lucky though, because i'm only 20 years old and i had the opportunity to know so many great and bad feelings. I really feel rich at this point.  This 2011 represents literelly a new life for me. And all i wish is for better days to come, happiness and love. Also, a happy new year to all of you, my flickr friends and may all your wishes come true!    . stock: texture  .  facebook fan page | blog | formspring | twitter   All rights reserved.

A couple of months ago I sold her on facebook, packaged her up well and sent her off with ridiculously expensive insured postage.  The buyer claims never to have been able to find out where she was, even by going to a sorting office.  Fair enough but I am still recovering from the nastiness that ensued after this calling me a liar for apparently not addressing it correctly, despite me sending proof of postage copies showing the address.  Anyway to cut a long story short the buyer walked off with a full refund whilst I sat having to wait and hope she would work her way back.  Finally yesterday she came home again.  The labels on the front showed finally I had put the correct address and the postie hadn't found the place.  There seems some closeure now as I know I did nothing wrong, despite the nasty messages.  Trouble is I am 14 down with postage I am not going to get back as it was an attempted delivery and I looked at her wondering what to do, sell her, change her?  Ii took the plunge this morning and spent time today customising her.  Having done so I am finally liking her agin - perhaps it was fate.  Maybe I will sell her again some time but for now I'm leaving her here!   I have only ever experienced lovely people in the Blythe community and hear of strange unfriendly experiences; It has seriously shaken me and upset me to be called a liar, when I am not.  Strange how people can be lovely until something goes wrong and, even if no one is at fault they just turn on you.  It's sad to think there is such lack of humanity and respect sometimes.  I would never be nasty with someone when it is not their fault.  Please don't comment on this experience, just the image or work.  I'm not talking about it as any sort of retribution, no names will be mentioned, just to explain the custom work and try and lift some of the lingering sadness about the experience."

Although we made it out quite late, we were able to help a little by distributing water and food to a few people.  Although downtown Ishinomaki was hit very hard by the tsunami, it was very uplifting to see the progress that had already been made.  Military supply camps, squads of police, and groups of volunteers were all working tirelessly in restoration.  The downtown area seemed to be getting far more attention than any of the other areas I've visited, but rightfully so, since it has a far higher population density.    Despite the incredible progress that had been made, there is clearly still a lot to do.  The chorus of destroyed boats, cars, and houses again echoed throughout the town.  Oil-logged muck permeated through the hills of debris and toxic smells wafted through the air, but people managed to keep their spirits up regardless.   - Hide quoted text -  The most somber part of the day for me, was after we left the downtown area and made our way up to Hiyoriyama park.  I would sometimes come up to Hiyoriyama to view the cherry blossoms, watch the sunrise, or relax after archery.  Every time I went up to the park, I was stunned by the natural beauty and panoramic view of this sprawling city creeping to edge of the ocean.  This time, however, I felt as though I was punched in the gut with the starkest realization of utter destruction that I had experienced until this point.  The once beautiful view of a thriving city reaching out into the ocean, was replaced with the surreal image of toppled homes and bare foundations.  A handful of cars weaving through nearly impassable roads created the only movement in what could easily be confused with a garbage dump or wasteland.   I know that eventually the area will be restored, but it will take a lot of work and time to heal the wounds.

These outward evidences of difficulty of thinking and movingare, however, more marked in the next stage of the depressive phase,that is, in acute melancholia, while here it is more usual to see thepatients merely preferring to be by themselves, disinclined to associatewith others, keeping to their room, and quite unable to make anymental effort.

We all were so different - we had different backgrounds, we had different languages - but we shared a Holy Father and we shared a Blessed Mother and, in praying to her, Ive never felt so close to the Church, I've never felt so powerfully the gift of brotherhood and sisterhood within the Church by virtue of our Baptism. We're united in the Church, we're united by having a father, both in heaven and at the Vatican, but we're also united by our mother, and in her love and her 'yes' that gives us the opportunity to be courageous and to say yes to our daily crosses and our daily sacrifices. It's been very hard saying goodbye to Pope Benedict XVI, but I look to Mary to give me the strength to get through it, but more than the strength to get through it, the strength to grow through it, and to grow towards Christ and closer to my brothers and sisters in Christ.""  ~Joseph from the USA  Lourdes grotto at the Shrine of St. Jude, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA."

It is a visual testament to the need for eliminating violence. The Garden is a symbol of hope for peace and renewal in our lives, our community, and the world.  After walking around this garden and looking at the stones, I found these two stones lying next to each other: ""Two Brothers"" - John Fitzgerald Kennedy, 35th President of the United States, and Robert F. Kennedy, 65th Attorney General of the United States."

I don't know why, maybe because I guess that I'm actually missing school. I don't know, but something it just working for my and photography at the moment. Anyway this one really made me want to upload and I guess I did. I wanted to go for more a of a classic look with this and a little less conceptual and photoshopped.  Summer is good though. I've got some pretty big news to release soon so keep an eye on my blog and my flickr stream to see it when I tell it and maybe I will start posting more. I have some other cool concepts in mind and we'll see what happens. I guess maybe more of my life at the moment is less waiting for specific moments and more living in the moment but oh well.

Upon closer inspection, I found this wonderful Grecian style angel atop a grave dedicated to four young children from the one family.  The earliest death registered upon the headstone was 1875.  I was struck by the beauty of the figure, yet at the same time the cherrubic face with its blind white eyes cast toward the heavens disturbed me a little.  They still do..."

We visited the 9/11 Memorial when we were in NYC.  It is a very beautiful memorial, very respectfully & thoughtfully done. It was sobering & intense, yet, somehow, peaceful & hopeful at the same time.  If that makes sense. But still, even after 12 years, there's an overwhelming sadness of the massive loss that was sacrificed that day. Although I did not know anyone who perished on 9/11, it still touched me dramatically & poignantly, as if I was just hearing it for the first time! Never forget. Never forget those names that surround each of the pools -  each lives & stories - individuals who are being missed daily by the people who love them. That is powerful. It is so sad to hear the stories by the loved ones of the victims. But it is amazing to hear of resiliency & hope, despite the tragedy, and to see positive things grow out of the devastation. What I took away from the memorial is that it is important to keep the sadness, the empathy, the pain, the individual & the love imbued into this tragic event, as that is what makes us human and lets us connect and understand each other, so that we would not do this, or anything harmful, to others. We cannot be casual & callous & apathetic & distant & unfeeling & numb, or we are no better than the perpetrators. My heart goes out to the survivors, the victims & their families & friends.  #911 #911memorial #neverforget #nyc #wtc #nineeleven #worldtradecenter #septembereleven #southpool #resilience #memorial  68 Likes on Instagram  3 Comments on Instagram:  jessikav18: Well said.

I rushed home on the train today to be with my family at the hospital. Please pray for him. The doctors aren't being too optimistic.  UPDATE 2/24/09: Today was rough. My grandpa just wanted to go home. He was sick of being at the hospital and he made sure everyone knew it. The doctors agreed to let him go home, but we only had him home for about two hours before we had to call an ambulance and have him rushed back to emergency. He will remain at the hospital until a hospice care facility can be arranged, and then they will move him. I am so glad that I was able to rush home on the train yesterday, because his spirits were much higher and he was making jokes like he always used to. It is crazy how different the situation is from day to day. I am completely emotional and mentally drained! I will update this post tomorrow if anything changes. Thanks to everyone who is praying and thinking of us during this rough time!!!!"

Built across an area of 7 hectares (18 acres), the historical Old Ballaarat Cemetery is located about one and a half kilometres from Ballarat's heart with its boundaries on Macarthur Street, Creswick Road, Lexton Street and Pigah Street.   Ballarat's first public cemetery was recorded in 1856, when the first official cemetery burial took place on the 20th May. Local records indicate that whilst this was the first official burial, ceremonies took place in the area of the Old Ballaarat Cemetery in the late 1840's and thereafter, which was even before the discovery of gold in Ballarat and the subsequent Gold Rushes that drew people to the city from around the world.   Allow the elegant and ornate Victorian gates on the corner of Macarthur Street and Creswick Road to usher you into a world of grand and simple monuments to the dead, and to a slice of Ballarat's fantastic history.  The Old Ballaarat Cemetery is filled with historical figures from Ballarat's past as many burials were early settlers who were looking to make their fortune on the goldfields. People mentioned in my own photostream are amongst those buried here; Richard Henry Sutton of Sutton's Music Store in Sturt Street; George and Clara Crocker who dedicated windows in St Peter's Church of England to their sons who died during the Great War; Thomas Stoddart who made Ballarat a city of marble statues; and Henry Richards Caselli who designed so many beautiful and iconic Ballarat buildings.  Two important monuments in not just Ballarat's, but Australia's, history were erected in the cemetery following from the armed insurrection of 1854 - the Eureka uprising; the Eureka Diggers' Monument in 1856 and the Officers and Soldiers Monument in 1879.  Situated in the centre of the cemetery, is the original Victorian rotunda built in 1892 to the designs of James and Piper and J. C. Smith.  The Rotunda has recently been restored to its original splendour.  Cemetery records show 35,000 interments have taken place since 1856, with 18,000 prior to 1884.   Appropriately for a city, once the wealthiest in the world, because of the Gold Rushes, in 1907 gold was discovered in the Old Ballaarat Cemetery when grave diggers were preparing a grave for a Mr. T. C. Thomas.    The 1920 gatehouse building was restored in 1997."

The most important plan is to be flexible.  I had wanted to do Sorrow with dead flowers, as I had done Joy with fresh flowers. It would have been very symmetrical. However, my dead flowers were not recognizable as such (I can retry) and the lighting that day (not the day I shot this photo) was not great for it.  I might take that photo anyways, but here is something that works toward that theme."

Although we made it out quite late, we were able to help a little by distributing water and food to a few people.  Although downtown Ishinomaki was hit very hard by the tsunami, it was very uplifting to see the progress that had already been made.  Military supply camps, squads of police, and groups of volunteers were all working tirelessly in restoration.  The downtown area seemed to be getting far more attention than any of the other areas I've visited, but rightfully so, since it has a far higher population density.    Despite the incredible progress that had been made, there is clearly still a lot to do.  The chorus of destroyed boats, cars, and houses again echoed throughout the town.  Oil-logged muck permeated through the hills of debris and toxic smells wafted through the air, but people managed to keep their spirits up regardless.   - Hide quoted text -  The most somber part of the day for me, was after we left the downtown area and made our way up to Hiyoriyama park.  I would sometimes come up to Hiyoriyama to view the cherry blossoms, watch the sunrise, or relax after archery.  Every time I went up to the park, I was stunned by the natural beauty and panoramic view of this sprawling city creeping to edge of the ocean.  This time, however, I felt as though I was punched in the gut with the starkest realization of utter destruction that I had experienced until this point.  The once beautiful view of a thriving city reaching out into the ocean, was replaced with the surreal image of toppled homes and bare foundations.  A handful of cars weaving through nearly impassable roads created the only movement in what could easily be confused with a garbage dump or wasteland.   I know that eventually the area will be restored, but it will take a lot of work and time to heal the wounds.

Mazzuca  Chief Scout Executive  Boy Scouts of America  1325 Walnut Hill Lane  P.O. Box 152079  Irving, TX 75015-2079  Mr. Mazzuca,  It is with great sadness that I am returning my Eagle Scout medal to you. I was always proud of this medal; however, I no longer see it as a symbol of leadership, community service, and moral character. Instead, I see a symbol of bigotry and discrimination by the organization that it represents. Your recent reaffirmation of the anti-gay policy is disappointing. Scouting should be for everyone that wants to participate, not a select few.  I earned my Eagle Scout (Bronze Palm) in 1994, and was a Brotherhood member of the Order of the Arrow. I hold very dear to my heart the lessons and skills learned from my time scouting and they have helped me become the man I am today. Scouting taught me to lead by example throughout my life. Practicing this very skill, I will no longer ignore my morals and support your organization that openly discriminates and condemns individuals based on their sexual orientation.  Roughly only 2 percent of boys entering the Scouts will achieve the Eagle rank, so you should know that I do not treat returning this honored medal lightly. I am giving back my prized childhood possession to express my disapproval in your policy and my disappointment in an organization that I once was so proud to be a part of.  While you do have the right to limit who your members are, there is a great ambiguity in practicing what you teach. Boy Scouts are taught to have morals, and to do what is right. What message does it send to the youth of your organization that it is acceptable to speak one conviction while acting out another? A Scout should be trustworthy.  I strongly urge you to reconsider, and reverse your policies on sexual discrimination so that all boys and adult leaders, regardless of sexual orientation, can participate in Boy Scouts.  Regards,  Owen M Wartella "

It is primarily a final resting place for beloved pets, yet human beings also are interred there. Aspin Hill Pet Cemetery was established in 1921 and is owned and run by the Montgomery County Humane Society. A previous owner named it after a kennel in England, which is why there is an ""I"" in the additional spelling of Aspin."

I'm crying, I'm laughing, I'm such a mix of emotions. All I know is my life will never be the same, ever. I can't believe my brother passed away.  On a less depressing note, if anybody has suggestions on how to take better self portraits, that could and would be helpful."
