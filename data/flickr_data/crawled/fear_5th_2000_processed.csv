With the help of a few school friends, he quickly initiated himself to the mystery of spray cans on his neighborhood walls until Henry Chalfant and Martha Coopers Subway Art and Spraycan Art definitely converted him to the noble art.  After moving to the South of France for a few years, Bom.k returned to live in Paris and created the Da Mental Vaporz in 1999 with Iso and Kan. One monumental wall after the other, the crew continuously kept pushing the esthetical boundaries of graffiti, developing groundbreaking themes for the times, such as madness, life in the peripheral suburbs, social exclusion, fear and hate. With the new century, the crew opened up to a new generation of painters in the 2000 years, welcoming artists like Jaws, Gris1, Brusk and Dran and more recently Sowat and Blo in its ranks. Together, the 9 members of this iconoclast collective traveled the world, England, Spain, Denmark, Belgium and Australia, to participate to numerous festivals, put together ambitious DIY shows and above all, paint whatever comes in there way.  .....toOo Continue Reading knowngallery.com/exhibitions/current/  Opening reception January 11, 2014 | 8-11pm On view: January 11 - 25, 2014  GrosleFotoGraff 2014  www.Flickr.com/Groslee www.Tumblr.com/13eyesss  DMV crew website www.damentalvaporz.com/  Graffiti Futurism write up Bom.k has always been one of a kind in Frances Graffiti scene.

Still (8"" X 10"") Starring Ray Milland, Hazel Court, Richard Ney, Heather Angel, Alan Napier and Dick Miller. Directed by Roger Corman. synopsis Roger Corman's success with low-budget adaptations of Edgar Allan Poe tales continued with this third installment, the first to lack the commanding presence of Vincent Price. Instead, we have Ray Milland as tormented protagonist Guy Carrell, who is so traumatized by the death of his father -- whom he believes was entombed alive after suffering a cataleptic attack -- that he becomes convinced that he will meet a similar demise. Guy's mounting dementia rapidly undermines his recent marriage to the lovely Emily (Hazel Court), particularly after he begins the construction of a specially designed crypt rigged with numerous escape devices. Encouraged by Emily to face his fears, Guy decides to view his father's remains, to prove once and for all whether he died peacefully. When the crypt is opened, however, what he finds there is so horrifying that he succumbs to a cataleptic episode himself, which doctors misdiagnose as a fatal heart attack... and Guy's worst fear soon becomes a reality. Milland's performance conveys the requisite amount of hand-wringing torment (in the mode of The Lost Weekend), even if he fails to capture the manic intensity that Price brought to the other Poe films. Corman's deft direction, employing a rich palette of colors and superb widescreen compositions, is on a par with the series' finest installments. "

Military positions were added to review civilian vehicles under the context of the war against drug trade in this region that has been greatly affected. In this context this celebration stands as a long-running tradition of celebrating the Christian Easter, between fireworks and geological alerts, the faithful celebrate in an eruptive environment which has embed the joys and fears as social elements exposed to the crisis.

I was part of a non-violent group of protesters. We tried to march to the center of the city, when the policy attacked us with no reason. They only fired tear gas, so it was okay. We put up our arms and went back to de-escalate. The police came nearer. When they were about 15m away of us, they started aiming at us and shooting with rubber bullets. We were a group of perhaps 50 people, slowly moving backwards with our hands in the air. A girl next to me was shot in the face. Her face was full of blood and the left side of it was numb. She didn't hear on that side anymore. I tried to help her and to send her to hospital. The police continued shooting. A lot people got hurt... the air was full of screams. A few hours later, things totally escalated in Strasbourg. At this time, most of us were either hurt or full of fear, so we went back to the protest camp. Since that time, I know what democracy is about."

The reason behind choosing this was because the exam board had given us a topic called 'unusual viewpoints'; aqua phobia is an unusual fear of water so I felt i could experiment and play with different images underwater that would give a different perspective. In this image that I took, I used a lot of ink to create a 'flow' within the piece as if the figure is fragile in the water. The background was composed of yellow and blue hues mixed with a white wash on top to make it more realistic.    "

Little did she know that these humble beginnings would turn into a passionate lifestyle where the pursuit of balance was at the forefront. After one year of slacklining in the USA, she traveled to Europe and began the more extreme aspects of the sport, Longline and Highline.  Longlining invokes extended focus-times, endurance and control despite the elements. To keep your mind focused on one feat for such a long time is a new challenge for the human mind. Faiths current longline best and the female world record is 222m (728ft).  Faiths ambitions as a highliner were humble in the beginning, however Highlining took everything she thought she knew about fear and threw it into the sky. To stand on one inch webbing stretched across a void, with all exposure penetrating ones vision and unhinging your brain, every iota of your being is telling you not to be there. This is fear and each step across that line pushes it slowly away.   Faith broke the original female world record within 4 months of highlining, and has since set the female world record for Highlining length at 315 feet (96.5meters); record for height was in the Swiss Alps at 1200m (4000ft) from the valley. She continually breaks her own records to set new ones. She has an extensive free solo (walking with no security) record, the longest of which is 28m (92ft).  Free solo continues to be a major focus for Faith, as the feeling of walking a highline with no security or safety line is the ultimate experience in mind and body control. One of her greatest motivations is to help promote and support other women in the realm of extreme sports, a discipline dominated by men. One method of doing this is organizing the annual Girls Only Slackline Festival, which has been 3 years running, held in Czech Republic. She hopes the idea will catch on and other such gatherings can take place around the world. In addition, she aims to continue establishing new lines around the world, opening highlines for future people to repeat."

But, few can match the vision and total commitment of the famous 13th Commandant, Gen. John A. Lejeune. In 1921 he issued Marine Corps Order No. 47, Series 1921.   Gen. Lejeune's order summarized the history, mission, and tradition of the Corps. It further directed that the order be read to all Marines on 10 November of each year to honor the founding of the Marine Corps. Thereafter, 10 November became a unique day for U.S. Marines throughout the world.   Soon, some Marine commands began to not only honor the birthday, but celebrate it. In 1923 the Marine Barracks at Ft. Mifflin, Pennsylvania, staged a formal dance. The Marines at the Washington Navy Yard arranged a mock battle on the parade ground. At Quantanamo Bay, Cuba, the Marine baseball team played a Cuban team and won, 9 to 8.   The first ""formal"" Birthday Ball took place on Philadelphia in 1925. First class Marine Corps style, all the way! Guests included the Commandant, the Secretary of War (in 1925 the term ""politically correct"" didn't exist; it was Secretary of War, not Secretary of Defense), and a host of statesmen and elected officials. Prior to the Ball, Gen. Lejeune unveiled a memorial plaque at Tun Tavern. Then the entourage headed for the Benjamin Franklin Hotel and an evening of festivities and frolicking.   Over the years the annual Birthday Ball grew and grew, taking on a life of its own. In 1952 the Commandant, Gen. Lemuel C. Shepherd Jr., formalized the cake-cutting ceremony and other traditional observances. For example, Marine Corps policy now mandates that the first piece of cake must be presented to the oldest U.S. Marine present. The second piece goes to the youngest Marine. Among the many such mandates is a solemn reading of the Commandant's birthday message to the Corps.   Like the U.S. Marine Corps itself, the annual Birthday Ball has evolved from simple origins to the polished and professional functions of today. Nonetheless, one thing remains constant, the tenth day of November! This unique holiday for warriors is a day of camaraderie, a day to honor Corps and Country. Throughout the world on 10 November, U.S. Marines celebrate the birth of their Corps -- the most loyal, most feared, most revered, and most professional fighting force the world has ever known."

It seemed to me to possess some ofthe objections long ago filed against Malgaignes hooks used for fracture of thepatella. Blake, however, tells us that it is the most perfect of methods by whichtraction can be made upon the femur because it permits the placing of thelimb in an absolutely correct position and acts directly upon the fragment with-out fixing or injuring the knee. With it a weight of six kilos produces as mucheflfect as fifteen kilos attached by the ordinary adhesive bands. The objectionto it is the fear of infection at the site of the pin or tongs, but present experienceseems to prove that the tongs at least may be emploved with impunity (Lt.Col. Blake, Ibid.).

If, however, there is great deformity, much soft-part injury, ormarked swelling, immovable dressings may induce sloughing, edema, gangrene,or faulty union. In the above-named cases use ordinary splints for the first fewdays; then, if it is desirable, the immovable dressing can be applied. Plaster-of-Paris bandages are used with great care in very young children, as gangrene mightresult from careless application. It is dangerous to keep old or feeble personslong in bed, as they are prone to develop bed-sores and hypostatic pulmonarycongestion. The period for the artificial retention of the fracture varies withthe seat of the fracture and the age and condition of the patient.
