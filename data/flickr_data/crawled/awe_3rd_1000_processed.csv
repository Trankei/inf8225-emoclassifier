As you stand in awe, the dramatic history of Prague permeates the air. The Old Town Square (Staromstsk nmst) is one of two main squares in Prague (Wenceslas Square is the other, just 5 minutes walk away).  With its ancient buildings and magnificent churches, this is one of the most beautiful historical sights in Europe.  Dating from the 12th century, the Old Town Square started life as the central marketplace for Prague. Over the centuries buildings of Romanesque, Baroque and Gothic styles were erected around the market, each bringing with them stories of wealthy merchants and political intrigue.  The Old Town Square's most notable sights are the Old Town Hall Tower & Astronomical Clock, the Church of Our Lady before Tyn and St. Nicholas Church.  At the centre of the Old Town Square is the Jan Hus statue, erected on the 6th July 1915 to mark the 500th anniversary of the reformers death. The groundswell of supporters for his beliefs during the 14th and 15th centuries eventually led to the Hussite wars.   All Rights Reserved"

She was born in a tiny little village by the mountains named Only. It was a peculiar place because every person was taught to try to be identical to one another. So they wore similar clothes, they had the same haircut, they ate alike, they had matching smiles! they even got married among them so they could preserve their own features! For long time she wondered if this kind of life made sense to her but she was afraid to ask because according to the leaders those who dont follow the rules would fall into affliction and bad luck. But still, little by little Azul started to make herself different to the others. Although the residents of Only hadnt realized of her changes, she started to talk about it to her family and close friends. They couldnt believe her words and thought it was a great tragedy! She felt rejected,  I feel I dont belong here any more she pondered. One day the village leaders heard about Azul wanting to change the rules!!! Then, the news were spread all over town! Many people went to see her and tell her she was making a big mistake! Azul answered: ""Im just different to you all!. They threatened her saying that she would be isolated in a house out of town where she would be visited and fed once in a while!! She was not a good example for the inhabitants of Only ! When she saw such a big trouble she went desperate, sad and scared so she ran away to the woods. On her way she fell in the middle of the forest. Suddenly she felt something was bringing her up. She realized there was a giant flower growing up from below her. She was still in awe when she noticed many people of town were pointing at her. Azul felt ashamed so she covered her face with a hand and raised up the other towards the sky as if she was asking for mercy or help. Unexpectedly she felt that another hand was grabbing hers and pulling her up to the sky before the astonished reaction of every one who was there. When she was in the clouds she perceived everything shiny white so she closed her eyes, then she heard a voice saying: Azul, you love your people and your people loves you, love will overcome all obstacles among you Then she opened her eyes and there she was in her bed...it was 6 am. Afterwards, she took courage to tell everything to the people of her tiny little village.but Azul saw them through eyes of love knowing that they loved her back. She left town some days later and discovered other places, other ways of life, different paths that she never imagined they existed She was totally accepted! But she always loved that people she grew up with. They were always her friends and love overcame every difference between them."

The locals there find it comical when others marvel at the rainbows...its a common occurrence in Monteverde...with clear skies and rainbows galore...it set the pace for my descending trip from the cloud forest. La Fortuna's landscape is dominated by Volcn Arenal. I was told 80% of people who visit La Fortuna actually get to see the full view of the volcano as there are too many clouds. I was fotunate to be able to see the whole thing and wow what a sight. If you havent seen a volcano as I hadn't, it is awe inspiring, such a massive feature in the landscape. After sleeping a night, the next day I hiked around the Volcano and got to see a nice view of the valley and Lake.

It opened in 2004.    Since then, it has had multiple structural problems including many roof leaks, sprinkler system failure, mold growth, masonry cracks and others, given rise to a major law suit that was finally settled in 2010. (Source: Wikipedia)  When you walk into or around the building you feel none of that. You will be simply in awe!  It is hard to focus on a single aspect of the building, it appears chaotic, makes your eyes wonder all over the place, never finding a resting spot. There are no right angles (hardly any), a seemingly hapharzard mix of materials and colors, and yet it seems to function. Those working there seem to enjoy it.    Go see for yourself, as a Gehry fan you will not be disappointed! If you're not a Gehry fan (yet), you'll either become one, or you'll shake your head. Either way, that's what monumental architecture is all about!

What a beautiful quiet place it is! Having checked out some locations prior one morning when we awoke the weather looked lovely so we jumped in the car and headed for the nearby Tarn Hows which is a National Trust property. We would have a nice walk around the Tarn but also I would be taking some IR shots with my Panasonic.   Anyone who hasnt been to this place should put it high on their list as its stunning! Just as you arrive at the first viewing point youre blessed with an amazing scene... the tarn surrounded by many fells and ranges both near and far. From right to left you have Fairfield Horseshoe, Helvellyn, High Raise, Lingmoor Fell, Sergeant Man, Side Pike, The Langdale Pikes, Bowfell, Crinkle Crags, Coniston Old Man and many more in between. I was in awe as I jumped out of the car in the middle of the track to see it unfolding in front of us. To see some of the fells we've climbed in the last year or so all together was amazing and even more so considering 2 years ago we didnt even know what a fell was!    After much gasping and pointing we jumped back in the car and headed down to the proper carpark and headed off along the footpath. As it was so early there was only 1 couple there with their dogs which was good as Ive heard it can be quite hectic! As we walked around to the East side there was photo opportunities everywhere as the water began to flatten out giving some excellent reflections which is what I had in mind. I took various shots around half of the Tarn before the promising weather clouded over and went a bit grim but I was more than happy. This shot is taken to the East side where there is a smaller area that actually appears to be nearly separate but isnt.  Tech Info...  Panasonic G5 converted to Full Spectrum. Olympus M.Zuiko 9-18 f4-5.6 9mm 1/500s f7.1 ISO 160  Filters...  B&W 090 (590nM Super Colour)  Processing Info...  I opened the RAW file in DxO Pro Optics 9 as it handles IR RAW files much better than Adobes programs and made some basic adjustments before saving as a TIFF file. I opened the tiff in PS CS6 and used the Khromagery Action to switch the red & blue channels which is necessary to create false colour IR shots and it also does some other preset changes such as Auto colour and tone and levels adjustments. Then I made a Hue/Sat adjustment layer to slightly alter the colours before running the shot through Imagenomic Noiseware to remove a bit of noise. Lastly I saved the shot in various sizes before uploading to the web.

Hidden away in Treptower Park, we got lost looking for it and by the time we found it we were the wrong side of the massive wrought iron railings that surronded it and had to walk round the perimeter until we found the entrance.

Newgrange (Si an Bhru) is a Neolithic passage tomb, constructed circa 3200BC, making it older than Stonehenge and even the Pyramids!  It is truly monumental/megalithic/monolithic.  Awe inspiring! Awesome! It is part of the Bru na Bohne complex of Neolithic monuments and is an integrated part of the Neolithic landscape of Ireland. Within it is a single passageway, leading to 3 small chambers, for the placement of the dead, on large flat basin stones.  The central chamber is illuminated during the winter solstice by a shaft running parallel and above of  the main entrance chamber.  The chamber roof is corbelled.  The sides of the chambers are composed of large (mainly  decorated( slabs of rock, with smaller boulders sandwiched in between to act as shock absorbers & to counter any movements. The public are allowed into the main chamber, but no photography.   I was dumb struck! Why? It represents engineering & mathematical skills of the highest order.  The structure was built from the inside, outwards including the decorated slabs.  To put it into context, this is akin to decorating your house & selecting the wallpaper prior to it being built!  it represents planning skills to the highest order.  These wonderful people invented:  Operational Management; Logistics; Supply Chain Management; Project Management; Linear Programming; Team Building; Civil Engineering; Mathematics.  Who were they?  And just when you have got your head around these skills, you have to start rethinking because the Bru Na Bohne complex was just a part of the planned Irish landscape.  Circles within circles; those spiral designs, the Celtic swirl, without a beginning or end. And now to the 21st Century.  Welcome to the grotesque!  Welcome to Disneyland!  Newgrange never looked like this reconstruction!  There never was a wall of quartz boulders, or an angled retaining wall about the entrance.  These white quartz boulders formed a pathway about the entrance, as at Knowth.  Part of the ritual of entrance. I am not sure how any respecting archaeologist could have ever sanctioned this grotesque reconstruction. (Sorry about that smear on my lens!  Look at those wonderful skies above the monument.

He has a lot of experience and an incredibly versatile stream.  Fortunately, he gave me a choice of challenges to pick from:  I have several ideas for challenges that you can choose from for this round. I saw a tripod in your stream. I hope it was your equipment. If it was, you might put it to use doing some night photography. I will leave that one as general as that statement. I saw one golden hour shot and one blue hour shot. Maybe you could choose to go after images in those special light times. It is one of my favourite times to shoot. That tripod would come in very handy with the blue hour shot. Lastly, one of my favourite genres of images comes from the late 40s and 50s. The black and white portraits of that era put me in awe of the mastery of light that photogs like Karsh, Henri Cartier-Bresson, and Bruno Bernard achieved. As a third possible option, you might try your luck at something inspired by one of those masters. Let me know what you are going to go with in the end and I look forward to seeing what you come up with for me.  The instant I read his note, I wanted to try the golden hour shot.  Ideas instantly popped into my head - artistic portraits of my parents against the wheat crop, a striking shot of the sunlight against the crosses at the Passion Play, glorious yellow sunflowers at sunset.  However, anyone who's seen my recent pictures knows that Mother Nature hasn't been offering many golden rays of sunshine at day's end recently.  We've had rain, rain and more rain, and lots and lots of mud.  So, here's my attempt at the challenge: Norton in a rare moment of setting sun.  The light hit his beautiful chestnut coat and made him look even more brilliant than ever :-)  Gary, sorry it isn't a little more golden but I hope it fits the bill!   Thanks for the Push!  (I encourage anyone who wants to expand their photography repertoire to join up for a Round in the Challenge.  They're great fun!)    "

The nighttime views were simply breathtaking, from the way the trees were lit by the steps leading to the Terrace Caf and Dining Room, along with the hauntingly stark red lights by the building, itself, to the enormous trees lit beautifully by the grand lawn and those by the paths heading toward Large Lake and the spectacular Floating Trees. We wanted to share our experience of the visit to Longwood Gardens 2014 Christmas Spectacular (the main theme this year is BIRDS).  The festivities begin on Thanksgiving Day and continue through the end of the first week of 2015.  In recent years, we have found that it works perfectly for us to go on Thanksgiving Day, for we would celebrate TG early and afterward.  This allows an opening day attendance at Longwood, where the crowd is significantly less than during the peak weekend days.  There will be a good number of photos to view, and for the most part, presented in correct sequence.  Please check out our ALBUMS titled LONGWOOD GARDENS of Kennett Square, PA and/or CHRISTMAS SCENES for a better flow in exploring the photos, since the continuity is lost when uploading into FLICKR while many others are doing the same, thus, having a variety of shots mixed in between the ones representing our visit on this day.    The wide variety of flowers and plants at Longwood Gardens are absolutely stunning in all stages and species . . . truly a Garden of Eden for anyone with a deep passion for these gifts of nature.  The annual Longwood Gardens Christmas never fails to awe the visitors with one spectacular display after another.  Whether these are in the magnificently elegant grand Conservatory, or outdoors within the over 1,000 acres of fabulous grounds, each and every thing is meticulously planned and designed, always arriving at some fresh ideas and/or concepts, while also maintaining the traditionally classic holiday floral and lighting appointments throughout.  Given that the main theme for the 2014 holiday season is BIRDS, this can be seen in such spectacularly tasteful fashion throughout the displays of the vast indoor landscape.  From the moment one enters the architectural marvel of the Conservatory, whether through the main Orangery or the East Conservatory, an awe inspiring view awaits. "

Huge beasts stalked majestically through the streets of Norwich. Prehistoric birds flying overhead. A mythical world came alive.  This years Festival opened in awesome style with Invasion, a highly mobile  and highly exciting  street spectacle. Invasion created an all-enveloping experience, as prehistoric animals moved through the audience and animal voices sounded from every direction. The beasts, came from all sides, leaving people confused: should they follow or flee? But chaos was avoided by a magical song that attracts the animals and restored calm, leaving the crowds to go with the flow of the unique and enthralling event.  Large animals moved between the public. A mythical world came alive; animal sounds were heard everywhere. A dark figure appeared as a prehistoric bird flew overhead. The area was completely filled as all the creatures spread out, causing confusion among the people; should they run or follow? The chaos ended by a magical song that attracted the animals and calmed them!  Invasion - An unforgettable moving street spectacle that moves the crowd like a sea. People see impressive figures and forget the actors inside the costumes. All get carried away: this is a unique experience! Performed by Close-Act Theatre a professional company of stilt walkers, dancers, musicians, fire throwers and acrobats, training and rehearsing together on a regular basis. Close-Act also has a studio of costume designers, visual artists, graphic and industrial designers. Work-students from different colleges come to our studio often for an internship. Last but not least Close-Act has an office with fantastic people who maintain relations with both clients and performers. They are also involved in developing special concepts and scenarios and most of them combine the office work with performing or working in the studio. The different disciplines and backgrounds of all these people make for interesting interaction and a surprising mix when we are creating new performances. Leading forces and inspirators of Close-Act are artistic directors Hesther Melief and Tonny Aerts. From their brains the concepts for the performances originate and they give direction to all people until the performance reaches its final form. Close-Act was founded in 1991 and settled in a monumental farm in Tilburg in 2003. The actors and co-workers come from all over the Netherlands and Belgium. From the start Close-Act has been performing abroad. Mostly in Europe at first, but since the success of performances such as Malaya and the mobile acts Saurus and White Wings, Close-Act travels across the world. Close-Act is always on the move. The company aims on launching a new performance every two years. New mobile acts are created each year. Existing acts are constantly improved with new costumes, acting, dance and technical innovations. With Malaya Close-Act found a form that best suits their vision on Street Theatre. Instead of using a stage or a fenced-off playsite, the actors and mobile objects move between and above the crowd. This ultimate form of interactive street theatre has great impact on the audience. The big mobile objects and beautifully designed costumes are best suited for a large audience. Close-Act therefore performs mainly at street theatre festivals and large scaled events."

The many attractions like the horserides, the food vendors, the smell of roasted corn and colorful kites all bring a smile to my face even today.

They are probably one of the best-known mountain groups in the Alps. The three peaks, from east to west, are:  Cima Piccola/Kleine Zinne (""little peak"") Cima Grande/Groe Zinne (""big peak"") Cima Ovest/Westliche Zinne (""western peak"").  Until 1919 the peaks formed part of the border between Italy and Austria. Now they lie on the border between the Italian provinces of South Tyrol and Belluno and still are a part of the linguistic boundary between German-speaking and Italian-speaking majorities. The Cima Grande has an elevation of 2,999 metres (9,839 ft). It stands between the Cima Piccola, at 2,857 metres (9,373 ft), and the Cima Ovest, at 2,973 metres (9,754 ft).  Numerous routes lead from the surrounding communities to and around the peaks. The most common route is from Paternkofel/Monte Paterno to the alpine hut Auronzo at 2,333 m (7,654 ft), over Paternsattel (Patern Pass) to the alpine hut Dreizinnenhtte/Locatelli at 2,405 m (7,890 ft), and then to the peaks. There are a number of other routes as well.  Since the front line between Italy and Austria during World War I ran through these mountains, there are a number of fortifications, man-made caves, and commemorative plaques in the area."

One of the trips was to visit the Chateau de Fontainebleau. The palace is located 55 kilometres south-east of Paris in the sub-prefecture of Seine-et-Marne. I took the Paris metro to Gare de Lyon where I hopped on another train to the destination. After I got off of the train, it was just a simple taxi ride to the palace which makes this a great day trip destination.   Dating back to the 12th century, the Palace of Fontainebleau has over 1500 rooms (!) , 130 acres of land, and is the only palace that has been continuously inhabited for over seven centuries hosting many royal families.

I would have to say that Hood River, Oregon is a new favorite spot for me to shoot! I like all of the rolling hills, orchards and spectacular views of Mount Hood to the south and Mount Adams to the north. Both of these volcanoes are imposing on the farming landscapes. I still like the Palouse region of Eastern Washington as well for different reasons, but to see these massive volcanoes on the horizon leaves you in a sense of awe and respect for the power of nature.   I remember driving around the day before trying to scope out this view but could not locate it. I decided the next morning to interrupt a local police officer's morning coffee with some fellow Hood River citizens and ask what road I could drive to to get a classic view of the orchards, barns and Mount Hood. Well the entire group graciously told me of several locations, but this particular spot I was keenly interested in as I have seen some of my fellow Flickr friends shoot some amazing shots from this location.   This is a combination of three exposures (-2,0,+2) merged and tonemapped in Photomatix. I then moved to Photoshop and did a slight crop. I also selectively ""Dodged and Burned"" some of the highlights and shadows. I sharpened in Topaz ""In Focus"" and then moved to Lightroom to pull back some of the saturation as well as add a slight vignette and grain.   Thank you for your support, views, comments and faves. I appreciate them, especially during this time of extreme busy-ness  that I have been experiencing!

Believe it or not this is the third time that I have attempted to photograph this staircase, first time during open house last year, second during a tour and this one. All previous attempts I was not happy with as they were just not quite lined up correctly for my liking and also the light coming in through the windows plays havoc with the camera's metering, I still think this would be best visited at night and with a tripod when you don't have that light blasting through the windows but anyhow I am happy with this.  I didn't actually plan to take this image again but I took it while I had a spare 15 minutes before meeting Richard Hurst the other week. I asked the security guard and he nicely said yes that I could take a few images so St Pancras get my 'Seal of Aproval' :-)  Also you maybe wondering why I called this image 'Grinning Like a Cheshire Cat', well everytime I kept looking at it during post processing it kept reminding me of the Cheshire Cat in Alice in Wonderland, I have no idea why but it just does, can you see him? ;-) Or maybe it was the fact I was grinning after I got this image ;-)  Photo Details Sony Alpha SLT-A77 Sigma 10-20mm 1:4-5.6 EX DC HSM RAW f/8 10mm ISO800 1/13s exposure  Software Used Lightroom 4.4  Information The St. Pancras Renaissance London Hotel is a hotel in the English city of London, forming the frontispiece of St Pancras railway station. It opened in 2011, but occupies much of the former Midland Grand Hotel which opened in 1873 and closed in 1935. Between 1935 and 2011, the building was known as St Pancras Chambers and was used as railway offices.  The upper levels of the original building have been redeveloped as apartments by the Manhattan Loft Corporation, and retain the St Pancras Chambers name.  Planning permission was granted in 2004 for the building to be redeveloped into a new hotel. The main public rooms of the old Midland Grand were restored, along with some of the bedrooms. In order to cater for the more modern expectations of guests, a new bedroom wing was constructed on the western side of the Barlow train-shed. As redeveloped the hotel contains 244 bedrooms, 2 restaurants, 2 bars, a health and leisure centre, a ballroom, and 20 meeting and function rooms.  At the same time, the upper floors of the original building were redeveloped as 68 apartments by the Manhattan Loft Corporation.  The St. Pancras Renaissance Hotel opened on 14 March 2011 to guests; however, the formal Grand Opening was on 5 May - exactly 138 years after its original opening in 1873.  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Pancras_Renaissance_London_Hotel"

The festivities begin on Thanksgiving Day and continues through the end of the first week of 2015.  In recent years, we have found that it works perfectly for us to go on Thanksgiving Day, for we would celebrate TG early and afterward.  This allows an opening day attendance at Longwood, where the crowd is significantly less than during the peak weekend days.  There will be a good number of photos to view, and for the most part, presented in correct sequence.  Please check out our ALBUMS titled LONGWOOD GARDENS of Kennett Square, PA and/or CHRISTMAS SCENES for a better flow in exploring the photos, since the continuity is lost when uploading into FLICKR while many others are doing the same, thus, having a variety of shots mixed in between the ones representing our visit on this day.    The wide variety of flowers and plants at Longwood Gardens are absolutely stunning in all stages and species . . . truly a Garden of Eden for anyone with a deep passion for these gifts of nature.  The annual Longwood Gardens Christmas never fails to awe the visitors with one spectacular display after another.  Whether these are in the magnificently elegant grand Conservatory, or outdoors within the over 1,000 acres of fabulous grounds, each and every thing is meticulously planned and designed, always arriving at some fresh ideas and/or concepts, while also maintaining the traditionally classic holiday floral and lighting appointments throughout.  Given that the main theme for the 2014 holiday season is BIRDS, this can be seen in such spectacularly tasteful fashion throughout the displays of the vast indoor landscape.  From the moment one enters the architectural marvel of the Conservatory, whether through the main Orangery or the East Conservatory, an awe inspiring view awaits. "

Having done a very early morning start at Liberty State Park on Christmas day of 2013, while thoroughly enjoying the awe inspiring experience along the waterfront walkway with one of the worlds greatest urban landscapes (and waterscape) in and around the New York Harbor, I decided to do the same again this year; however, given some prior obligations, it was the day after Christmas, instead.  Like the previous year, nary a soul besides me was out before sunrise, and it was not until about an hour after the sun first appeared that a group of visitors emerged.  So, I basically had the entire waterfront park to myself for a pretty good stretch of time. If you have never been there, it really is a sight to behold when one can see the majesty of the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island with its unique place in American history, and the recently completed Freedom Tower, standing above all as the new proud symbol of what every person aspires to possess . . . FREEDOM.  It took my wife and me quite a few years after the infamous, heart wrenching event of the fallen Twin Towers, simply known as 9-11.  If you go to our FLICKR albums, you will see the mid to latter construction stage of the Freedom Tower in photos under New York Skylines or the Meadowlands landscapes and such.   Initially, we both felt that nothing could ever replace or exude the same powerful presence as the original Twin Towers, and felt disappointment in the design of the Freedom Tower as it began to evolve from ground up, but when it reached its latter stages and the way the natural light over the course of any given day would play a significant role in its image, an overwhelming sense of admiration for the concept began to grow, and when finally completed, it all seemed to be a perfect visual symbol to the new landscape of New York Harbor.  As we used to feel driving to the City or passing by from the New Jersey side, a similar kind of pride is felt with this new, great landmark that has made such a significant impact on the psyche of our citizens.   Many of you have likely stopped reading this long narrative, but you can probably surmise that aforementioned pride in these comments.  Having personally seen the falling of the Twin Towers from work three miles away on that horrific weekday morning with all the confused and maddening reports being broadcasted on the radio and television news, it becomes an experience that is, indelibly, forever etched in my mind . . . So, that day is always present whenever I look toward the southern anchor of the Manhattan skyline, and I absolutely love how the Freedom Tower has not replaced, but serves as a natural extension of the Twin Towers and honors those who have lost their lives, accordingly. Looking farther north offers the Empire State Building and Chrysler Building, the two iconic skyscrapers that ruled the architectural world of construction beyond imagination in the early 1930s.  And the Goldman-Sachs Tower of Jersey City, on the New Jersey side of the Hudson River, can hold its own amongst the giants of the NY Harbor landmarks.  The captivating style of this particular modern design somehow compliments the glorious Manhattan skylinepractically blending in as part of a grand visual sweep from one side of the harbor to the other.  And furthermore, the famous Brooklyn Bridge can be seen in the distance between the southern end of Manhattan and the borough of Brooklyn, and to the far south, the Verrazano Bridge dominates the entry way to the great harbor that saw thousands upon thousands of aspiring immigrants who traveled the vast Atlantic Ocean, ultimately arriving in America, while taking their first step on our soil at Ellis Island, under the protective presence of Lady Liberty.   One historic reminder after another permeates the air, causing just about everyone to feel something truly special.  Even if visitors know little of the history here, it is nearly impossible not to be awe struck.    In closing, the two extreme ends of the waterfront park, the northern point and the South Lawn, offer monuments that are so powerful and captivating.  I am always taken by the Liberation Monument, which honors all of those who served our nation in the fight for freedom.  If any of you ever have the chance to visit LSP, please do take some time to genuinely appreciate this statue from all angles, for it almost comes to life.  The northern end of the park has the New Jersey EMPTY SKY 9-11 Memorial, which must be seen.  A surge of emotions will flood through your body as you stand at the site and gaze across to the East where the Twins once stood. Anyhow, I hope that this passage would serve as a motivating factor to visit Liberty State Park, if possible.  Regardless of the degree of personal meaning this may have, it is still a landscape that is well worth the trip . . . Nothing like it in the world. "

Although the site was known in Aztec times as the 'Birthplace of the Gods' it is actually significantly older, with most of the major structures built between 100-250AD and the city, one of the largest ever ancient settlements in the Americas, was believed to have been still inhabited up to the 8th century.  Today the vast scale of the complex, particularly the so called Avenue of the Dead, nearly 3km long and flanked by ancient ruins and terraces, continues to awe visitors. At the north end of the Avenue sits the Pyramid of the Moon, whilst it's much larger counterpart, the Pyramid of the Sun, sits halfway up it's eastern side. At the southern end sits the Ciudadela complex which centres on the smaller pyramid of Quetzelcoatl, earlier and more ruined than the larger pyramids but retaining it's stunning original sculptural decoration on part of it's western face, featuring the iconic feathered serpent heads.  Aside from the great ceremonial structures there are also residential buildings, particularly the palatial complex at the north west corner that retains some vivid fragments of it's original mural decoration.  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teotihuacan"

The upper photograph, taken on 28 May 2008 from a helicopter, shows the cone of the Southeast Crater, which mostly grew between 1989 and 2007 (actually, the most constructive period was between 1998 and 2001, when the cone grew by nearly 100 m). The last eruption from the vent at the top of that cone was during the night of 6-7 May 2007; a few weeks later, a collapse pit formed on the lower east flank of the cone (seen at right). Three powerful episodes of lava fountaining occurred on 4-5 September 2007, 23-24 November 2007, and 10 May 2008 from this pit, which then fell silent for nearly three years, except for repeated, and sometimes spectacular collapse of its rims. Finally, in January 2011, the pit started erupting again, and since then it has been the site of 33 rather intense and awe-inspring episodes of lava fountaining (paroxysms), the latest so far on 16 March 2013. Much of the material ejected by these paroxysms has accumulated around the former pit, growing into a huge cone, that we now informally call ""New Southeast Crater cone"". This cone is seen in the lower of the two photographs, taken from a helicopter on 4 March 2013, from a position close to that of the upper photograph. Amazingly enough, also this photo has already been surpassed by reality: two more lava fountains, on 4-5 and 16 March 2013, have led to further growth of the New Southeast Crater cone, and all that we know about Etna indicates that this story is far from being over."

According to legend, it was here, in the awe-inspiring basin at the mountain's summit, that the demigod Maui snared the sun, releasing it only after it promised to move more slowly across the sky. Haleakal means ""house of the sun""; the park encompasses the basin and portions of the volcano's flanks.  A United Nations International Biosphere Reserve, the park comprises starkly contrasting worlds of mountain and coast. The road to the summit of Haleakal rises from near sea level to 10,023 feet in 38 milespossibly the steepest such gradient for autos in the world. Visitors ascend through several climate and vegetation zones, from humid subtropical lowlands to subalpine desert. Striking plants and animals such as the Haleakal silversword and the nn may be seen in this mountain section.  The summit-area depression, misnamed Haleakal Crater, formed as erosion ate away the mountain, joining two valleys. This 19-square-mile wilderness area, 2,720 feet deep, is the park's major draw.  From east of the rim, the great rain forest valley of Kpahulu drops thousands of feet down to the coast. The upper Kpahulu Valley is a biological reserve (no public access), home to a vast profusion of flora and fauna, including some of the world's rarest birds, plants, and invertebrates. Some insects and plants evolved in the Kpahulu Valley and live nowhere else. "

We dropped down the steep rocks and the full scene was revealed.   It was hard to know which picture to take as the opposite shore was perfectly in both directions.   I took time to just let it all sink in... a fish jumped an it was the only clue the water wasn't a glass mirror.   I finally decided to face down stream just above a large boulder.

The Northern Lights is a common name for the Aurora Borealis (Polar Aurorae) in the Northern Hemisphere.  Auroras are caused by charged particles, mainly electrons and protons from the solar wind, entering the atmosphere from above causing ionisation and excitation of atmospheric constituents, and consequent optical emissions.  The green colour seen in this shot, the most common auroral colour, is caused by excited molecular oxygen.  However produced, the Aurora is simply beautiful.  Note: unlike many aurora shots, I have resisted the temptation to massively jazz up the images in post-processing so that the sky is full of garish colours. Very nice, but not realistic and not really what I actually saw.  "
awe,http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7334/10744658643_3cbd28b97c_z.jpg,2,3,"Cordoba, Spain Cordoba - one of Spain's great cities.  Situated about 150km north east of Seville and with a current population of just over 300,000,  Cordoba was founded by the Romans at the highest navigable point on the Guadalquivir River.  For that reason it became a port  of great importance, used for shipping Spanish olive oil, wine and wheat back to Ancient Rome. The Romans built the mighty bridge crossing the river, now called ""El Puente Romano"". But Cordoba's hour of greatest glory was when it became the capital of the Moorish kingdom of El-Andalus, and this was when work began on the Great Mosque, or ""Mezquita"", which  after several centuries of additions and enlargements  became one of the largest in all of Islam. When the city was reconquered by the Christians in 1236, the new rulers of the city were so awed by its beauty that they left it standing, building their cathedral in the midst of its rows of arches and columns, and creating the extraordinary church-mosque that we see today. As well as the unique mosque-cathedral, Cordoba's treasures include the Alcazar, or Fortress, built by the Christians in 1328; the Calahorra Fort, originally built by the Arabs, which guards the Roman Bridge, on the far side of the river from the Mezquita, and the ancient Jewish Synagogue, now a museum."
