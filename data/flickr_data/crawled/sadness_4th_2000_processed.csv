This cemetery has the graves of the British personnel who died in World Wars. The graveyard is now maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. It was very well maintained and every grave has an identical tombstone with name, age and rank, regiment symbol on it.  The average age of people buried here was aroung 24. There were rows of graves of 19 year olds! Look closely and you will see the age on the tombstones in this pic.

This occurred inside a community center for gay and lesbian youth who are afraid to come out to the wider community.  A man with a loaded gun came in at around 11pm and opened fire. The statements coming from the police say that he wore a mask.  You could say that all those youths who depended on this center for their free expression are forced to wear a mask on a daily basis. Their mask doesn't cover their face, rather their soul.  A spontaneous gathering of thousands began to congregate outside the center. They walked from there to the center of the gay and lesbian community in Tel Aviv in a parade of both sadness and hope."

And listened, for I thought I heard Gods voice; And, knowing whatsoeer he sent was best.Dared neither to lament nor to rejoice. Then with a smile, that filled the house with light,My errand is not Death, but Life, he said; And ere I answered, passing out of sight.On his celestial embassy he sped. T was at thy door, O friend! and not at mine,The angel with the amaranthine wreath. Pausing, descended, and with voice divine. Whispered a word that had a sound like Death. Then fell upon the house a sudden gloom,A shadow on those features fair and thin; And softly, from that hushed and darkened room,Two angels issued, where but one went in. THE TWO ANGELS 163 All is of God! If he but wave his hand, The mists collect, the rain falls thick and loud, Till, with a smile of light on sea and land,Lo! he looks back from the departing cloud.

The first, a youth, with soul of fire, Held in his hand a golden lyre; Through groves he wandered, and by streams, Playing the music of our dreams. The second, with a bearded face,Stood singing in the market-place,And stirred with accents deep and loudThe hearts of all the listening crowd. A gray, old man, the third and last.Sang in cathedrals dim and vast, A PSALM OF LIFE 165 While the majestic organ rolledContrition from its mouths of gold.

I ACTUALLY ended up liking this one. :)   I decided to have a focus on my back since it's been in so much pain for the past week. :/   About the quote and feel of the picture:  EVERYONE does have a weakness, no matter how strong you think you are. There is SOMETHING that can bring you to a breakdown.   Look at the people around you. They may be that person that you see almost every day at work or school that CONSTANTLY smiles. They have experienced, are experiencing, or WILL experience something that breaks them down. Something that eats at them. Something that tears them apart.   I'm sure we can ALL relate.   That's why it's SO important to spread love rather than hate. Some people have the audacity to actually show hatred towards people JUST because they're going through something. Maybe because they're hurting on the inside, and wish they could let it out.  It's SO important to spread love no matter your mood.   Short message, but very important.  QOTD: Where have you felt weakness the most in your life?  About a year ago, and before that for about two years. I was weak, wasn't myself, and didn't make my own decisions. It's such a great feeling to realize what you're worth.   Which just so EVERYONE that reads this knows....you ARE worth something....you're PRICELESS in this world...don't forget that. Don't amount yourself to less.  <3<3<3<3  www.formspring.me/hollydev"

He wants to know how we will react with trouble, sadness, or even heartbreak. Through the pain, Jesus still wants you to put your trust in him. It shows him that you are willing to follow him no matter what the circumstances. That is true love.  Okay so this is my best friend from school! He is a beastly ninja boss. He has helped me through a lot this year. Considering this year hasn't been the easiest for me, I very much appreciate him being there. He loves tacos!"

What I want to express the most is the need for children to be understanding and supportive of their aging parents. Nothing is harder to repay the love and care our parents lavish on us. When your mother gets old and weak, she likewise needs your love and care. Even if you cant cure her illness, you can still sit next to her, hold her hand and comfort her. I opted for black-and-white photos with a five-graded scale of grays and near-grays to convey an atmosphere of sickness, decline, weakness, suffering, and life which slowly wilting away. Every time I pressed the shutter release button, the lens captured a moment of depression and sadness. Winners SpeechWinners Speech: My foremost goal is to put across my personal point of view and touch peoples hearts. And these  are made with passion and untiring devotion to their subject. To me, photography is a way of expressing and releasing my feelings and of telling stories about the relationships and emotional interactions between people. At here, I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to Mr, Chun-Lu Chen, my boss at Photo shop, and Professor Chung-Hsing Huang and Mr. Chao-Liang Chen, my mentors, for their instructions, guidance and support.

Sigo mirando a otro lado y hablando con Fray.  Tratamiento: Con Aperture. Original en JPG. Tiendo a ceirme al formato cuadrado para presentar la escena. El hecho de que oculte la cara del que da la limosna no es tanto porque quiera dejarlo en el anonimato; sinceramente no entr en escena con tanto disimulo que tuve que aplicar. Con el formato cuadrado termin de quitar algo ms, dejando slo el rostro del mendigo. Luego modifico luces bajando las altas y aumentando ligeramente la definicin y la vibracin de color.

He raises his eyes and smiles when someone approaches directing hand to his. Almost without stopping drop the coin and greet: ""Good day - Thank you""  Taking up: I'm on the other end of the small passageway that overlooks the square, relatively far from the scene. I am subject to Fray and seemingly distracted look away while the camera is on the waist pointing to the beggar. I can not fit well because any exchange of glances break the situation. Someone comes directly. I look askance at the screen, frame and shot again. I keep looking away and talking to Fray.  Treatment: With Aperture. Original JPG. I tend to stick to the square format to display the scene. By hiding the face of the person giving alms is not so much because I want to leave anonymous; honestly did not enter the scene with both dissembling I had to apply. With the square format finished removing something else, leaving only the face of the beggar. Then I change lights down the high and increasing definition and vibration lightly colored.

While I could never kill one of these creatures myself, I can respect hunting for food, and making use of as much of the animal as possible. Venison is one of the rare red meats I can enjoy once in a while. My uncle is a taxidermist and captured the life-like beauty of these two bucks. Some might think taxidermy is gross or creepy. Sometimes it is, but it also does require great artistic skill to do well. I can't deny that. But I also wanted to capture a sadness here. These animals once roamed free in a Wisconsin forest, and in an instant, they were dead. I wanted to represent an apologetic portrait here. I'm the type of person who apologizes to the bugs I kill in my apartment. So to these two bucks I say, I'm sorry you couldn't live a longer life chewing on leaves and enjoying cool breezes. I hope your souls are doing that now."

Although we made it out quite late, we were able to help a little by distributing water and food to a few people.  Although downtown Ishinomaki was hit very hard by the tsunami, it was very uplifting to see the progress that had already been made.  Military supply camps, squads of police, and groups of volunteers were all working tirelessly in restoration.  The downtown area seemed to be getting far more attention than any of the other areas I've visited, but rightfully so, since it has a far higher population density.    Despite the incredible progress that had been made, there is clearly still a lot to do.  The chorus of destroyed boats, cars, and houses again echoed throughout the town.  Oil-logged muck permeated through the hills of debris and toxic smells wafted through the air, but people managed to keep their spirits up regardless.   - Hide quoted text -  The most somber part of the day for me, was after we left the downtown area and made our way up to Hiyoriyama park.  I would sometimes come up to Hiyoriyama to view the cherry blossoms, watch the sunrise, or relax after archery.  Every time I went up to the park, I was stunned by the natural beauty and panoramic view of this sprawling city creeping to edge of the ocean.  This time, however, I felt as though I was punched in the gut with the starkest realization of utter destruction that I had experienced until this point.  The once beautiful view of a thriving city reaching out into the ocean, was replaced with the surreal image of toppled homes and bare foundations.  A handful of cars weaving through nearly impassable roads created the only movement in what could easily be confused with a garbage dump or wasteland.   I know that eventually the area will be restored, but it will take a lot of work and time to heal the wounds.  If you would like to donate to Red Cross Japan, please visit their website here:  www.jrc.or.jp/english/relief/l4/Vcms4_00002070.html  Also, I have decided to donate all of the profits from any of the pictures sold on my website until at least March 11, 2012.    carstenknoche.com/march-25-2011-japan-earthquake-disaster/  Lastly, you can read more stories and see more pictures from a variety of different people by purchasing Quakebook.

Taking pictures just has not been the most important thing for me at this point, but nevertheless I will continue squeezing the shutter whenever I can.  Hopefully, we will all be able to see dramatic transformation of these areas back into their original beauty, but it is clearly a long road ahead.    If you live in the area and wish to help, please contact me and I will send you a list of volunteer centers throughout Miyagi as well as a list of important equipment to bring with you.  If you do decide to volunteer, please go with an organized group and bring the necessary equipment.  I don't mean to frighten anyone, but I was notified again today that there still are dangerous areas.  Don't go alone, please.    Here is a video that I took of the area the same day I took these pictures:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=CazswZd454o  The area that these pictures were taken, was utterly obliterated by the tsunami.  After a few hours of hauling items back and forth between my friends' destroyed home, I started to get a headache and feel sick from the fumes.  In my last post, I also mentioned that I had heard of people setting off explosions and starting fires from trying to light their cigarettes.    We worked amidst pure devastation for about 5 Hours, however we were only able to salvage a handful of their things. Sometimes it was hard to know what was theirs, since the tsunami had swept a whole city worth of belongings through the first floor of their home.  Surprisingly, the four-year-old house was in pretty good shape despite the fact that it was blown back off of its foundation about 200 feet and sat about 10-15 degrees off of level (in the video I said 60 feet, but I meant to say 60 meters.  The distance and angle is still a total guess, but you can judge for yourself in the pictures/video).  The structure of house was in such good condition, that we were able to walk up to the second floor and salvage most of the dry, smaller items.  Their daughter was just given a brand new bed and desk-set as an elementary graduation present, but we unfortunately could not take it out.     The reason we needed to go and salvage what we could as quickly as possible was because the house, although it did not look like it, was sitting in the middle of a road.  The city and self defense force had given them  only a few more days to clear out before they would have to bulldoze it down.    I asked the family if they had tsunami insurance, but apparently there is no tsunami insurance.  They will receive a small amount of money from the government, but it will not even come close to covering the damage they sustained.    The most dumbfounding part of that day for me was not surreal experience of walking through the total destruction of an entire town, but rather the laughing and smiling that came from a family who just lost everything- everything except each other.  Items and worldly possessions are of little value against the people we hold dear.  I tried to reciprocate the smiles, laughter, and healthy conversation (especially in light of the children), but it wasn't easy fighting off the grim emotions lurking below the surface.    This last weekend, I was able to volunteer for a short time in Downtown Ishinomaki and also take a few more pictures/video  The downtown area seems to be getting a lot more attention, and about half of the roads seem traversable.  Downtown also felt incredibly safe during the day time due to the dozens of police and military (both Japanese and US) walking the streets and distributing food and water at the camps.  I will post those pictures later this week.  I know my website is in shambles right now (I just have not had time), but I'm hoping to have it looking nicer as soon as possible.  I've never really sold anything from my website, but I'm going to donate all of the money I earn from ANY of the pictures I sell (not just the quake photos) to Red Cross Japan for at least the next year.

Maybe this won't make sense to you unless you know me but today I figured out that I am not my depression, or my anorexia or my body dysmorphic disorder. I have all of these things, and they will always be a part of me but they don't define me, they don't make up who I am as a whole.

In my opinion, the tough thing about self portraits (besides getting the focus right when using the self timer...grrr) is making sure the expression is an accurate depiction of how you're feeling in the moment. In the first few takes (which I didn't post) I felt extremely self-conscious, wanting to make sure the look was ""ok"".....then I realized that's missing the whole point of this 365 day thing, and in this shot I actually told myself to just relax and look however it was that I actually FELT. This is the result. And it absolutely reflects my mood in that moment... a small lingering sadness, and a quiet peace (and the yoga helped beforehand). "

I took these photos about an hour before he passed away. I had left to make prints of these photos for my grandma and we got the call. My dad was talking to him and he said ""Jesus loves you dad!"" and my grandpa replied ""Amen!"" so we have some comfort knowing that he made peace with God (he had also told my mom over the weekend that he was ready and prepared to go).  The funeral will be on Monday, so I'm sure that it will be a whirlwind until then. My grandpa was a WWII veteran so he will be buried at Fort Custer.   "

The breed is widely employed in Abruzzo where sheep herding remains vital to the rural economy and the wolf remains an active and protected predator.  Centuries of breeding the dogs to be gentle with lambs but fiercely protective of their flock has created a breed that will bond to families and show a calm, intelligent disposition. However, the dogs may display hostility towards outsiders and they are not suitable companion dogs for urban areas due to their large size and need for open space.

It seemed that the only thing that could represent todays subject is a self portrait. So I set up that camera, self timer on and thought about my baby boy. Click. I resisted the temptation to soften, warm, edit, flatter... even just going black and white would be like I was trying to hide something and I think a fundamental part of this is honesty. It has been 6 weeks and 6 days since my world fell apart. Since then I have endured some of the worst days of my life. As promised by almost everyone we have spoken to the days and weeks have served to numb that initial searing pain slightly. I have managed to glue some of the pieces of my shattered self together but I am painfully aware that I will never be the person I was before. The glaze has softened but the life has not fully returned to my eyes, I wonder if it ever will?  Several times a day I think of Cooper, how he should be with me, what we should be doing. This should be a picture of an exhausted new mum, sleep deprived but hopelessly in love with her new baby. I long to be that person. I am slowly recognising and accepting some of the truths of this situation: I am changed, this change will never be reversed. There is nothing I can do to fix this, nor reduce the time needed to recover. Every happiness in my future will always be tinged with sadness because one of my children will not be there to share in it - this is the truth that I am finding the hardest to accept. It is still very early in this difficult journey. I'm trying to allow myself to feel how I feel each day and not view the bad days as a backwards step."

I placed my model in positions of which represent sadness, pain and loneliness to create a sombre atmosphere and to also hide the identity of my subject creating a sense of mystery. My aim was to shock the viewer and I believe the use of text helps achieve this as well as the studio lighting used in order to create heavy shadows and of course, the use of photoshop. "

The hurt of not knowing this person anymore - and the all-encompassing dark void left - transforms someone who was once happy into a barely recognisable creature.

Taking pictures just has not been the most important thing for me at this point, but nevertheless I will continue squeezing the shutter whenever I can.  Hopefully, we will all be able to see dramatic transformation of these areas back into their original beauty, but it is clearly a long road ahead.    If you live in the area and wish to help, please contact me and I will send you a list of volunteer centers throughout Miyagi as well as a list of important equipment to bring with you.  If you do decide to volunteer, please go with an organized group and bring the necessary equipment.  I don't mean to frighten anyone, but I was notified again today that there still are dangerous areas.  Don't go alone, please.    Here is a video that I took of the area the same day I took these pictures:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=CazswZd454o  The area that these pictures were taken, was utterly obliterated by the tsunami.  After a few hours of hauling items back and forth between my friends' destroyed home, I started to get a headache and feel sick from the fumes.  In my last post, I also mentioned that I had heard of people setting off explosions and starting fires from trying to light their cigarettes.    We worked amidst pure devastation for about 5 Hours, however we were only able to salvage a handful of their things. Sometimes it was hard to know what was theirs, since the tsunami had swept a whole city worth of belongings through the first floor of their home.  Surprisingly, the four-year-old house was in pretty good shape despite the fact that it was blown back off of its foundation about 200 feet and sat about 10-15 degrees off of level (in the video I said 60 feet, but I meant to say 60 meters.  The distance and angle is still a total guess, but you can judge for yourself in the pictures/video).  The structure of house was in such good condition, that we were able to walk up to the second floor and salvage most of the dry, smaller items.  Their daughter was just given a brand new bed and desk-set as an elementary graduation present, but we unfortunately could not take it out.     The reason we needed to go and salvage what we could as quickly as possible was because the house, although it did not look like it, was sitting in the middle of a road.  The city and self defense force had given them  only a few more days to clear out before they would have to bulldoze it down.    I asked the family if they had tsunami insurance, but apparently there is no tsunami insurance.  They will receive a small amount of money from the government, but it will not even come close to covering the damage they sustained.    The most dumbfounding part of that day for me was not surreal experience of walking through the total destruction of an entire town, but rather the laughing and smiling that came from a family who just lost everything- everything except each other.  Items and worldly possessions are of little value against the people we hold dear.  I tried to reciprocate the smiles, laughter, and healthy conversation (especially in light of the children), but it wasn't easy fighting off the grim emotions lurking below the surface.    This last weekend, I was able to volunteer for a short time in Downtown Ishinomaki and also take a few more pictures/video  The downtown area seems to be getting a lot more attention, and about half of the roads seem traversable.  Downtown also felt incredibly safe during the day time due to the dozens of police and military (both Japanese and US) walking the streets and distributing food and water at the camps.  I will post those pictures later this week.  I know my website is in shambles right now (I just have not had time), but I'm hoping to have it looking nicer as soon as possible.  I've never really sold anything from my website, but I'm going to donate all of the money I earn from ANY of the pictures I sell (not just the quake photos) to Red Cross Japan for at least the next year.  Please take it into consideration. Here is my site:  www.carstenKnoche.com  In addition, I contributed many of my pictures to QUAKEBOOK.org, and if you have never heard this organization, PLEASE check them out as well.  All of Quakebook's revenue will also go towards the Red Cross Japan.   www.quakebook.org/   Lastly, you can contribute directly to Red Cross Japan here:  www.jrc.or.jp/english/relief/l4/Vcms4_00002070.html  Thank you very much for facing this tragedy with us. With cooperation, strength, and perseverance, we can accomplish anything.  Take care, Carsten Knoche"

For this round of Get Pushed, I was partnered with annadelf, who has an extensive portfolio of portraits, including a 100 Strangers project, of which she appears to be nearing the end, and many other candid street photography.  Her challenge was:  You take the ages of all the members of your close family at home and write down the total....then you take a book you are reading, or have enjoyed (any kind...poetry, whatever) and go to the page corresponding to the total you wrote down, then count down to the line corresponding to the date when you do this....and illustrate that line with a photo, preferably creating an emotion (of course, you have to tell us what it said).  I thought this would be a bit easier, but when I did the math and looked up the lines, not too many of the books I had on hand had something that would be interpreted easily. However, with ""Of Mice and Men,"" I was able to find this quote in a broader passage that was easier to interpret with a suitable location not too far away. I decided to do this as a bit of a self portrait. I hope this conveys a bit of the sadness that Lennie has toward the end when things go wrong for him and his friend George.

In the second he came into my eyes, I can't move, I can't think,  my mind was frozen by the coldness from this sadness.  I still cannot verbalize but something is not going right in this society."

Part of me is excited with the unknown ,as I am a huge history buff the thought of finding some relic of the past fills me with a large sense of wonderful adventure to explore their shatter remains. The broken windows and doors beckon me in as she lays herself bare to my curiosity. Once inside the only sound is the whisper of the wind along the walls of rooms that once knew life and laughter and I feel a deep sadness for her seemingly forgotten and lonely  state. So I spend a few moments with her reveling in her decaying beauty and snap a few shots so she knows she is not forgotten and her age has made her far more beautiful to my admiring eyes."

Well I heard there was a secret chord  That David played, and it pleased the Lord  But you don't really care for music, do ya?  Well it goes like this  The fourth, the fifth  The minor fall and the major lift  The baffled king composing Hallelujah  Hallelujah  Well Your faith was strong but you needed proof  You saw her bathing on the roof  Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you  she tied you to her kitchen chair  And she broke your throne and she cut your hair  And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah  Hallelujah  Well baby I've been here before  I've seen this room and I've walked this floor  I used to live alone before I knew ya  I've seen your flag on the marble arch  Love is not a victory march  It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah  Hallelujah  Well there was a time when you let me know  What's really going on below  But now you never show that to me do you?  And remember when I moved in you?  And the holy dove was moving too  And every breath we drew was Hallelujah  Hallelujah  Well maybe there's a God above  But all I've ever learned from love  Was how to shoot somebody who'd out drew ya  And it's not a cry that you hear at night  It's not somebody who's seen in the light  It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah Hallelujah"

Life can bring so much happiness when it takes the shape of outstanding art such as the one Tony gave us...but life reminds us too how fragile it can be, how it is an ephemeral trip. My thoughts go to his beloved wife and child to be...and to all who admired his work, who had the privilege to know him, they will miss Tony, as well as all anonymous passerbys who discovered his talent on the walls of Paris, Naples, Havana or Sao Paulo..."
