For hundreds of years the area has been famous for its King Arthur legend, including the historic castle on the cliffs. For more than 800 years a magical tale has been told that Tintagel was the birthplace of the noble King Arthur.   He was protected from evil by Merlin the magician who lived below the castle in a cave.   As many mysteries remain about Tintagel as facts are known. Today the two are inextricably entwined and the village remains one of the most awe inspiring and romantic spots in the UK.   The castle is found in the spectacular setting of the dramatic north Cornwall coast. Atlantic breakers crash against the cliffs, and through Merlin's cave, as visitors climb the steep but breathtaking path to Tintagel Island.   The ruins of the 13th Century stronghold of the Earls of Cornwall continue to be explored by people from all over the world.   On the mainland itself, the gaunt remains of the medieval castle represent only one phase in a long history of occupation.   TINTAGEL CASTLE HISTORY   Even before Richard, Earl of Cornwall, built his castle, Tintagel had come to be associated with the conception of King Arthur.   During the summer months, a story-teller is often on hand to bring the legends of King Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot to life. In the bleak mid-winter, Tintagel is a place that inspires the imagination of writers and poets. It's a place of dreams, romance and legend.   In June 1998, excavations were undertaken under the direction of Professor Chris Morris of the University of Glasgow, on a relatively sheltered and small site on the eastern side of the island, first excavated in the 1930s.  Pottery from the 5th and 6th centuries was found, as well as some fine glass fragments believed to be from 6th- or 7th-century Mlaga.   Even more remarkable was a 1,500-year-old piece of slate on which remain two Latin inscriptions. The second inscription reads: Artognou, father of a descendant of Coll, has had [this] made. Who exactly Artognou was continues to be a subject for lively speculation."

It is the only cultural National Park set aside by the National Park System.[4] It occupies 81.4 square miles (211 km2) near the Four Corners and features numerous ruins of homes and villages built by the Ancient Pueblo peoples, sometimes called the Anasazi. There are over 4000 archaeological sites and over 600 cliff dwellings of the Pueblo people at the site."

I'm pleased by the juxtaposition)  I was very touched by this dream and pretty happy with how I could recall it it's not been this clear in a while  I am also grateful for waking up this early! the birds singing outside my window coupled with the hum of machinery and the woosh of cars going by on the hill  my half month away from here really makes me appreciate this place my photos plants and the strange landscape up here  i'm grateful to live here  but. . . onto the dream should you care to read it  dd198 2012-07-16 M  dream just as I was getting up from reading the near-ending of that month's journal I heard a rustling and looked into the edge of the light the edge of the forest - a gigantic grizzly was lumbering out of the woods his fur shimmered in the security light he was big but still early summer thin and his horns still had a furry cover on them..  horns?  i'd never seen a bear with horns before this bear was at least 9 feet tall to his head the horns were easily another two or more feet and covered in a similar shaggy black furr as his body  he didn't give sign that he noticed me he was just sniffing around the perimeter I was very near the house so I didn't feel much in danger just Awe awareness that this huge thing lived near the house and could wander over at any time it was humbling and a bit frightening though exciting and I had to fight the impulse to stand and watch or even go to it. . .  all of this was in an instant out of my right field of view something emerged out of the dark coming towards me with great strides  it was Grandfather he told me not to worry the bear hadn't noticed me but I should be going in  what was he doing out in the darkness?  the bear heard out conversation and ran back into the house  I was excited went into the house and saw Grandmother at the sink she stepped back so I could wash my hands I made a prayer as I did so as this was her kitchen where all the beautiful food came from this was her sink where we washed the vegetables. . . a feeling of reverence. . .  I asked if she saw the bear she answered monosyllabically but in atone that implied she did not want me mentioning it to my brother and sister  they had mentioned this earlier. . . as a reason to why I shouldn't sleep outside in the yard at night I had no idea they could be that big what would it do if it got its paws on me?  I woke then at 7:30!  before all this . . .  I'd been traveling where we're we? Ireland? scotland? Minnesota? staying at this huge old house relatives,  sure not dissimilar feeling to where last night's play was but that was commercial this was more residential  however it still had a TV studio and live theater in it  another woman was staying there who had been a part of the band. . . not the Tindersticks. . . ( Beautiful South?) but something like that but i was surprised she was doing performances on her own because i'd thought she was mostly a back up singer she was touring with her partner, a man but she was on her own now perhaps he was the song writer? perhaps she was? I was surprised she was using the whole band's name. . . I'd seen ""them"" a few years ago in the city and these two people weren't even in the performance (though i know they'd been on recordings)  she was sleeping in a bed with a canopy but also wooden shutters and on the outside we're a whole bunch of chicken puppets obviously made, not live stylized but even without her hand I saw them moving of their own accord so life like I impulsively asked my mother if they needed feeding  they made no noise but they looked like they were clucking around as if they were eating bugs out of the cracks of the old wide beams of the floor  though I had seen this woman perform and would have enjoyed to do so again I walked into another recording studio to watch what was going on in there  it was The Jimmy Fallon show or Andy? or. . .  she whispered in my ear that he'd been on the air since the fifties when he came home from the war he tried just blending into society but he was so entertaining they gave him his own talk show and he'd been doing it all these years. . . used to be every night now he was down to just once a week. . . but still had his whole staff employed! that must be difficult for all of them to be so old and still doing this show but only once. . . maybe they were grateful  he still looked as if young but his era was apparent high and tight hair style big black suit (nothing like the Jimmy Fallon I know in this reality)  at the desk near me a woman with very girlish ways (though I'm sure she was at least 60) was smiling and reading some nightly news all tongue-in-cheek reporting I glanced back at him while he made an animated response when I looked back the woman had tucked herself under the desk and a man had taken her place going on in the same manner she had  it was an old trick to live-switch like that without editing or pause  kinda amazing  but I don't watch shows like that  I suppose it was shortly after that I went outside to take some fresh air I really wanted to sleep in the back yard to enjoy the stars the fresh night air but this bright security light was kinda spoiling the dark it was enough light to read my book by I sat in day lounge chairs reading all that had gone on that month written in a sparse rolling style as if and event could have happened in one long day instead of the whole month it's fading from me now. . . but I appreciated my writing style as this was a proof of a journal I had written and published and I was remembering some man I was talking about when I heard a loud sound at the edge of the darkness and stood up to see what it was: a huge bear it's fur black and oily reflecting much of the light from the house it's huge hairy horns above its huge hairy body it was just as attractive as it was terrifying i took a few steps backwards towards the house . . . it wouldn't rush at me, would it? I could get inside if it did though it was only about 70 feet away from me  just then the Grandfather came out of the darkness to my right in strong, long strides his presence was reassuring and we went into the house together where he suggested I was my hands for dinner. . .

This is a manual blend of over 9 exposures in Antelope Canyon near Page, Arizona. The slot canyon is one of the toughest places I've ever been to shoot, since the dynamic range is much, much than the camera can handle. Usually, the sky looks pure white or the depths of the canyon look pitch black.  In order to pull this off, I took 9 shots with different exposure times to capture everything from the bright sky to the deepest rocks. I decided that I would attempt a manual blend in Photoshop instead of using HDR tools. For those who aren't familiar with these terms, think of manual blending as laying all of those 9 exposures over each other, then manually uncovering the portions of each image that were exposed correctly.  So about 3 days later, I arrived at this. To me, it resembled the vibrant colors and crazy patterns of a kaleidoscope, hence the name. I tried to make this shot look as awe-inspiring as I felt in the canyon that day. I think I managed to capture just a tiny bit of that feeling here."

I went on a hike on the path ""cao negro"" which was much longer than epected and in pretty wet conditions. Nonetheless, the hike in new territory seeing and being in a new space is always good for the mind. After my journey to Monteverde, I went to the small town of La Fortuna. On my departing journey from Monteverde, there had to be at least 15 rainbows or ""arcoiris"" ...incredible. The locals there find it comical when others marvel at the rainbows...its a common occurrence in Monteverde...with clear skies and rainbows galore...it set the pace for my descending trip from the cloud forest. La Fortuna's landscape is dominated by Volcn Arenal. I was told 80% of people who visit La Fortuna actually get to see the full view of the volcano as there are too many clouds. I was fotunate to be able to see the whole thing and wow what a sight. If you havent seen a volcano as I hadn't, it is awe inspiring, such a massive feature in the landscape. After sleeping a night, the next day I hiked around the Volcano and got to see a nice view of the valley and Lake. Afterwards in the evening, I went to a natural hotspring river where the water was a pleasantly hot temperature and relaxed."

Not everyone will find this attractive, but I actually find it all the more remarkable for it.  Copious quantities of stained glass is visible in the windows and weirdly shaped apertures, but alas I was out of luck as it was all locked up. There was a notice directing people wishing access to the church to the priest's house behind it, but I could tell my efforts were in vain as my appeal to look inside was met with a puzzled frown and a suggestion that I come back for mass the following morning. He was perhaps busy which is fair enough, but for me living nearly 20 miles away returning wasn't so simple.   I wasn't overly keen on looking around after a service, the timings didn't suit my trains and it would be likely busy, so when I saw 'confessions' listed 11-12 Saturday mornings thought that might be a better bet. Turned up to find the church was open but with a few people (inc. the priest I'd met before, who I didn't think would be overly keen to see me loitering again) sitting or kneeling quietly inside, I realised it was now exposition of the Blessed Sacrament instead. A very awkward time to look around, I'd have to content myself with quietly keeping out of the way in the chapels at the back and get some pics of their windows at least, but this wasn't enough for one member of the flock who noticed me and glared in a 'How dare you enter our church!' kind of way! I retreated out of sight into the baptistery to sit and look at a fine abstract window, but he decided to come and stand staring aggressively opposite me and clearly wanted to start something, but the atmosphere of awed silence prevented this and he left, but he'd made his point, I knew I was not welcome in this church.  I left shortly afterwards myself feeling frustrated (for the second time, not having been able to view or record the full interior) and deeply uncomfortable. I was hoping to bump meet my would-be assailant outside, having mentally prepared some suitable Biblical quotes about Christian behaviour since he displayed so little of it, but it was  most likely just an all too common case of being judged guilty of whatever before proven innocent.   So to summarise, this is one of the most remarkable modern church buildings I've seen, but from my experiences also just about the most unwelcoming I've ever visited. I'm sure, with hindsight, staying after a mass would have been a far better choice after all, reception might have been different (certainly couldn't be worse)."

This overlook affords expansive views of Yosemite Valley, El Capitan, Bridalveil Falls, and Half Dome that have captured the awe of visitors for nearly 75 years. The overlook was constructed in 1932 during an era that heralded a boom in design and development throughout the National Park Service, and helped initiate the National Park Service rustic design style. Wawona Tunnel and Tunnel View were determined eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 because of their exemplary design. Very little physical change has occurred to Tunnel Views physical features (including rockwork, circulation patterns, and configuration) since it was built in 1933. The site remains one of the most popular scenic overlooks in Yosemite National Park. Tour buses, tram tours, and single-family vehicles bring an estimated five to seven thousand people to the site per day during the height of the tourist season."

El Galen Andaluca is the only galen class vessel in the world sailing today.    This ten city, five state tour of the United States will span five months ending in Fort Lauderdale where the ship will be featured in the Winterfest Boat Parade on December 13th.  The galen class vessel was an ocean going ship type that evolved from the carrack in the second half of 16th century. Galens were constructed from oak, pine and various hardwoods for hull and decking. Hulls were usually carvel-built.  Hundreds of expert tradesmen, including carpenters, blacksmiths, shipwrights and pitch-melters worked day and night for months to make a galeon seaworthy.  To cover the expense, galeons were often funded by groups of wealthy businessmen who pooled resources for a new ship. Therefore, most galeons were originally consigned for trade, although those captured by rival states were usually put into military service.  The most common gun used aboard a galen was the demi-culverin, although gun sizes up to demi-cannon were possible. She was recently featured in the NBC mini-series Crossbones that starred John Malkovich as the legendary pirate Blackbeard!    "

According to legend, it was here, in the awe-inspiring basin at the mountain's summit, that the demigod Maui snared the sun, releasing it only after it promised to move more slowly across the sky. Haleakal means ""house of the sun""; the park encompasses the basin and portions of the volcano's flanks.  A United Nations International Biosphere Reserve, the park comprises starkly contrasting worlds of mountain and coast. The road to the summit of Haleakal rises from near sea level to 10,023 feet in 38 milespossibly the steepest such gradient for autos in the world. Visitors ascend through several climate and vegetation zones, from humid subtropical lowlands to subalpine desert. Striking plants and animals such as the Haleakal silversword and the nn may be seen in this mountain section.  The summit-area depression, misnamed Haleakal Crater, formed as erosion ate away the mountain, joining two valleys. This 19-square-mile wilderness area, 2,720 feet deep, is the park's major draw.  From east of the rim, the great rain forest valley of Kpahulu drops thousands of feet down to the coast. The upper Kpahulu Valley is a biological reserve (no public access), home to a vast profusion of flora and fauna, including some of the world's rarest birds, plants, and invertebrates. Some insects and plants evolved in the Kpahulu Valley and live nowhere else. "

I love this photo for several reasons.  First and foremost, West Virginia is where my family has chosen to take our summer vacations for the past few years.  We love to escape from our home in Cincinnati to a place that has no wifi, limited cell service and many places where we can just be together as a family...uninterrupted. We spend our time swimming, hiking, playing boards games and preparing meals together. We feel like a real family when we are together in West Virginia, and not fulfilling someone else's agenda.  For me this photo represents the essence of living in the USA and the American spirit...a country road, a small house, working hard and a simple life enjoying the bounty that God has provided. When I took this photo I stopped in the middle of the road in awe by the beauty and I snapped this photo on my iphone. I inadvertently took the picture through the shaded area at the top of my car windshield which made the sky a dramatic blue/purple color.

The hole in the iceberg located directly in the center of the image immediately draws viewers' eyes to it as if to suggest that the iceberg is melting from the middle outwards. The texture of the bottom part of the iceberg is in direct contrast with the smooth box of ice sitting atop it as evidence that ice was falling off of the iceberg recently.  By framing only part of the iceberg in the shot, viewers cannot see how large the complete formation is. They are lead to believe that the majority of the structure is in the photograph. While this is unlikely, because it clearly extends to the right beyond the frame, the photographer's decision to frame the iceberg in this way makes it seem small in relation to the vast ocean and sprawling clouds above it. These features are only dramatized further by the high contrast that black and white adds to the image.  This interpretation is ironic considering that Salgado stated that his aim of this project was to ""photograph subjects that have ""escaped or recovered from"" climate change.  Whether this image has or has not been hurt by climate change the absence of people in the shot certainly adds to the sense of awe it inspires. It seems as though Salgado took the photograph from a boat, but there are no waves rippling out into the shot from his boat. This gives the image a uniquely voyeuristic quality that only adds to its beauty.   "

The tone is set : even the Beijing Olympics ceremony cant compete with the mass games organized by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). The show is held several times a week and welcomes tourists from all over the World, including the US, in one of the most isolated and despised country on earth. The well-called  mass games  are designed to emphasize group dynamics rather than individual performances as the supreme emblem of communism. Prepared by hundred of thousands performers all along the year, after their classes for the youngest of them, they are entirely dedicated to the NKs leader Kim Jong Il and his deceased father Kim Il Sung, considered as the  Eternal president  and  sun of the 21st century      In the surroundings of Pyongyang's May Day giant Stadium, two girls are running to perform for the Arirang show. They are already dressed in their gymnastic outfits, as well as some 100,000 others who participate to the performance. They all come to honour their self-proclaimed  dear leader  Kim Jong Il, after a very hard and gruelling training, since their earliest age. Yet, it has been many years that Kim Jong Il has not shown up, formally for business reasons. But officials now admit the western medias assertions of illness. Anyways, Kim Jong Il or not, the mass games are held every year in Pyongyang, as a means for the regime to show to the entire world the countrys strength and good shape. To reach this sole purpose, not less than 100,000 people are involved in a choreographed show of simultaneous dancing and gymnastics. Many symbols are displayed by thousands of trained athlets, whether they are adults or even children. Hand over their heart, the young pupils sing in chorus ""We are the happiest children in the world"", one of the famous propaganda songs in North Korea. Many dancers make movements either with ribbons or colourful flowers named  kimjonglias  after the leader Kim Jong Il. All along the show, a live band plays a ceremonious music.   On the background, some 20,000 young koreans sit on the terraces, facing the spectators. They flip coloured cards at a high speed to form a fresco of animated and detailed images, changing from one to another. Each time they turn the page to create a new giant picture, they cry out. It creates a awe-inspiring atmosphere, as the shout is mixed with the noise of thousands of pages turned at the same moment. The figures are stunning : to compose these images, 2000 children  are needed to make only one soldier, 20,000 for a north korean flag. Hiding a much more grim reality, the panels represent Pyongyang enlightened by night, wheat fields ready for harvest, scientists at work, atoms as symbols of the nuclear bomb and others for the reunification of two Koreas. One of the North Koreas myths (history according to them) is recounted by the means of a huge image made by thousands of children. It represents the two pistols reportedly used by Kim Il Sung, when he founded the Anti-Japanese Peoples Guerrilla Army in 1932. When the pistols appear, the audience applauses loudly. Among them, many soldiers attend the show as the ultimate award after years of good and faithful service.The thousands and thousands of boys and girls involved create a giant mass movement in the stadium which leaves the public stunned. These talented performers are used to that kind of performance: in North Korea they have to dance, sing, jump and spin around as many times as there are celebrations, always in praise of their leaders. There are mainly two sorts of shows. The first one is the classical artistic show, named ""Arirang"" after the famous korean folk song (whose story sometimes changes, but most often  recounts the legend of a disappointed woman who hopes that her lover will return to her metaphor of the break-up with South Korea). The second one is a more political show, which was untitled in 2008 ""Prosper our country"" and intended to show the countrys greatest achievements and its struggle against the foreign oppressors.  The show continues in the same way for one hour. Thereafter, the thousands of people present vanish in the dark and silent streets of Pyongyang, which contrast with the flood of lights and music in the stadium. Within the space of a few hours, it gives us a a strange feeling, between the real and unreal, of another universe both terrifying and fantastic.    Dans toute la ville, les publicits dArirang ( Grande reprsentation gymnastique et artistique de masse ,  Bienvenue  Pyongyang  etc.) mettent le profane en garde Entre aot et octobre, a lieu lune des plus grandes et impressionnantes reprsentations au monde. Le ton est donn : pas mme la crmonie des Jeux de Pkin ne peut rivaliser avec les mass games organiss par la Rpublique Dmocratique Populaire de Core (RDPC). Le spectacle se tient plusieurs fois par semaine et accueille des touristes du monde entier, y compris des Etats-Unis, dans lun des pays les plus isols et mpriss sur terre. Les biens nomms mass games ( mouvements de masse) sont conus pour mettre en avant les dynamiques de groupe plutt que les performances individuelles comme emblme suprme du communisme. Prpars par des centaines de milliers dartistes tout au long de lanne, aprs les cours pour les plus jeunes dentre eux, les jeux sont entirement ddis au leader de la Core du Nord, Kim Jong Il, et feu son pre Kim Il Sung, considr comme l  Eternel prsident  et  soleil du 21me sicle   Aux environs du Stade gant May Day de Pyongyang, deux filles courent pour participer au spectacle de Arirang. Elles sont dj en costume de gymnastique, tout comme quelque 100 000 autres qui participent  la reprsentation. Tous viennent pour honorer leur autoproclam  cher leader  Kim Jong Il, aprs un trs difficile et prouvant entranement, depuis leur plus jeune ge. Pourtant, cela fait plusieurs annes que Kim Jong Il ne sest pas montr, formellement pour des raisons professionnelles. Mais des officiels admettent les assertions des mdias occidentaux sur sa maladie. Quoi quil en soit, Kim Jong Il ou pas, les jeux de masse ont lieu chaque anne  Pyongyang, comme moyen pour le rgime de montrer au monde entier la puissance et bonne sant du pays. Pour atteindre ce seul but, pas moins de 100 000 personnes sont engages dans une chorgraphie de danses et gymnastiques synchronises. De nombreux symboles sont affichs par des milliers dathltes entrans, quil sagisse dadultes ou mme denfants. Main sur le cur, les jeunes lves chantent en chur  Nous sommes les enfants les plus heureux du monde , lune des chansons de propagande les plus connues en Core du Nord. De nombreux danseurs font des mouvements avec des rubans ou avec des fleurs colores appeles  kimjonglias , du nom du leader Kim Jong Il. Tout le long du spectacle, un orchestre joue une musique solennelle.   larrire-plan, quelque 20 000 jeunes corens sont assis sur les gradins, faisant face aux spectateurs. Ils retournent des cartes colores  une grande vitesse pour former une fresque dimages animes et dtailles, changeant de lune  lautre. Chaque fois quils tournent la page pour crer une nouvelle illustration, ils crient. Cela cre une atmosphre impressionnante, le cri tant ml avec le bruit de milliers de pages tournes au mme moment. Les chiffres sont stupfiants : pour composer ces images, 2000 enfants sont ncessaires pour faire un seul soldat, 20 000 pour un drapeau de la Core du Nord. Cachant une ralit bien plus dure, les panneaux reprsentent Pyongyang claire la nuit, des champs de bl prt  tre rcolt, des scientifiques au travail, des atomes comme symboles de la bombe nuclaire et dautres pour la runification des deux Cores. Lun des mythes de Core du Nord (ou histoire selon eux) est relat au moyen dune image gigantesque faite par des milliers denfants. Elle reprsente les deux pistolets que Kim Il Sung aurait utiliss quand il a fond larme de gurilla populaire anti-japonaise en 1932. Lorsque les deux pistolets apparaissent, le public applaudit bruyamment. Parmi eux, de nombreux soldats assistent au spectacle comme rcompense ultime aprs des annes de bons et loyaux services. Les milliers et milliers de garons et de filles participant crent un mouvement de masse gant dans le stade, qui laisse le public bahi. Ces artistes talentueux sont coutumiers de ce type de reprsentation : en Core du Nord ils doivent danser, chanter, sauter et virevolter autant de fois quil y a de clbrations, toujours  la gloire de leurs chefs. Il existe principalement deux sortes de spectacles. Le premier est le spectacle classique artistique, appel  Arirang  daprs la clbre chanson folklorique corenne (dont lhistoire quelques fois change, mais qui raconte le plus souvent la lgende dune femme due qui espre que son amant lui reviendra mtaphore de la sparation avec la Core du Sud). Le second est un spectacle plus politique, qui tait intitul en 2008  Que prospre notre pays  et qui tentait de montrer les plus grandes ralisations du pays et sa lutte contre les oppresseurs trangers.   Le spectacle continue de cette faon pendant une heure. Ensuite, les milliers de personnes prsentes disparaissent dans les rues sombres et silencieuses de Pyongyang, ce qui contraste avec le dluge de lumires et de musique dans le stade. En lespace de quelques heures, cela nous donne un trange sentiment, entre le rel et lirrel, dun autre univers  la fois terrifiant et fantastique.    Eric Lafforgue www.ericlafforgue.com "

I was fotunate to be able to see the whole thing and wow what a sight. If you havent seen a volcano as I hadn't, it is awe inspiring, such a massive feature in the landscape.

One of the trips was to visit the Chateau de Fontainebleau. The palace is located 55 kilometres south-east of Paris in the sub-prefecture of Seine-et-Marne. I took the Paris metro to Gare de Lyon where I hopped on another train to the destination. After I got off of the train, it was just a simple taxi ride to the palace which makes this a great day trip destination.   Dating back to the 12th century, the Palace of Fontainebleau has over 1500 rooms (!) , 130 acres of land, and is the only palace that has been continuously inhabited for over seven centuries hosting many royal families. Its proximity to the large forest of Fontainebleau made it a prime location for the Kings of France.  --- Read a dedicated post about Chateau de Fontainebleau with photos arranged in a set along with descriptions here:  Paris Day Trips - Palace of Fontainebleau  --  Interested in viewing all of my Paris posts so far?

I got given a lovely 4 star hotel near the airport by emirates with my ticket, which was great, and although the rooms were standard, it had awesome facilities including a bar in the middle of a swimming pool! After dropping my stuff off here I headed off to Old Dubai!  Culture is what interests me, so the older and more Arabic areas of Dubai were what I wanted to see. So I headed off to the gold Souq in al ras. Unfortunately it appeared to be a holy day, so not all of the gold stalls were open, but the amount of gold and goods on display was astounding anyway. Walking along around here I stumbled onto some awesome mosques as well. The atmosphere was lively, and different from what I am used to. I spent quite allot of time in this area searching for the spice souq aswell, although it was not until later that I found it. This area did seem a bit more westernised than I had hoped however, so I headed to the waterfront to catch an abra across the river. After walking up and down waterfront a couple of times trying to find somewhere to get on an abra, I gave up! I couldn't find it anywhere- it's probably just because I don't read Arabic! So instead I took the metro across, and found what I would consider my faviroute area in Dubai.  Although the views from the other side of the river was great, from this side it was fantastic. The crystal blue water, seagulls, old dusty background with colourful wooden boats floating along. Truly magnificent! The walk along the waterfront and around this area just took you back 20 years. Arabs wearing Classic Arabic light flowy clothing, head scarfs and skull caps. Children playing with birds, street stalls selling freshly squeezed orange juice, coconuts, and all manner of Arabic attire, spices and foods. Going further away from the waterfront were tiny lanes, just wide enough for one man, yet they had stores along either side, giving you am awe-inspiring claustrophobic shopping experience. I loved it.  Here I found the oldest fort in Dubai, which had been transformed into the Dubai heritage museum with all sorts of old artifacts. The building was ancient stone and sand, and just looked like a giant sand castle. So cool! It looked smaller than it was aswell, due to the rather large mosque built next door.  Walking further and further along the waterfront, with this ancient style Arabic life all around me, I decided I loved the Arabic life. The sound calling out for prayer, was incredible. I didn't think they did that in Dubai, but they do, and I loved it. The people always happy, the streets- dirty, small and sandy, but a world away from my own, and the sights, beautiful and majestic despite the general lack of colour. It was great. Not only this but the smells! The spices and herbs odour all around, gave you a real treat just to walk near. But the food- was even better. The Dubai street food was an explosion of flavours and herbs. It wasn't spicy, but very fragrant, and I loved it! I spent far longer here than I anticipated! But it was too great to leave..  20-12-13"

This years Festival opened in awesome style with Invasion, a highly mobile  and highly exciting  street spectacle. Invasion created an all-enveloping experience, as prehistoric animals moved through the audience and animal voices sounded from every direction. The beasts, came from all sides, leaving people confused: should they follow or flee? But chaos was avoided by a magical song that attracts the animals and restored calm, leaving the crowds to go with the flow of the unique and enthralling event.  Large animals moved between the public. A mythical world came alive; animal sounds were heard everywhere. A dark figure appeared as a prehistoric bird flew overhead. The area was completely filled as all the creatures spread out, causing confusion among the people; should they run or follow? The chaos ended by a magical song that attracted the animals and calmed them!  Invasion - An unforgettable moving street spectacle that moves the crowd like a sea. People see impressive figures and forget the actors inside the costumes. All get carried away: this is a unique experience! Performed by Close-Act Theatre a professional company of stilt walkers, dancers, musicians, fire throwers and acrobats, training and rehearsing together on a regular basis. Close-Act also has a studio of costume designers, visual artists, graphic and industrial designers. Work-students from different colleges come to our studio often for an internship. Last but not least Close-Act has an office with fantastic people who maintain relations with both clients and performers. They are also involved in developing special concepts and scenarios and most of them combine the office work with performing or working in the studio. The different disciplines and backgrounds of all these people make for interesting interaction and a surprising mix when we are creating new performances. Leading forces and inspirators of Close-Act are artistic directors Hesther Melief and Tonny Aerts. From their brains the concepts for the performances originate and they give direction to all people until the performance reaches its final form. Close-Act was founded in 1991 and settled in a monumental farm in Tilburg in 2003. The actors and co-workers come from all over the Netherlands and Belgium. From the start Close-Act has been performing abroad. Mostly in Europe at first, but since the success of performances such as Malaya and the mobile acts Saurus and White Wings, Close-Act travels across the world. Close-Act is always on the move. The company aims on launching a new performance every two years. New mobile acts are created each year. Existing acts are constantly improved with new costumes, acting, dance and technical innovations. With Malaya Close-Act found a form that best suits their vision on Street Theatre. Instead of using a stage or a fenced-off playsite, the actors and mobile objects move between and above the crowd. This ultimate form of interactive street theatre has great impact on the audience. The big mobile objects and beautifully designed costumes are best suited for a large audience. Close-Act therefore performs mainly at street theatre festivals and large scaled events."

Some of these renowned sights are the Arena, sixth largest in the world or Twin Gates, the Temple of Augustus, the well-preserved Roman Forum or the Communal Palace. However, not as much information is known about the impressive heritage of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy dating from the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, undoubtedly a real cultural and historic treasure. In fact, this refers to entire Pula, which from 1820 to 1916 was being architecturally shaped as a fortified town. Once the major naval port of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy Pula, together with its surroundings, has kept for over a century 26 magnificent forts or fortifications, as well as 8 artillery batteries, about 60 batteries, trenches, underground tunnels and many other points of interest. The outer ring of Pula's fortifications covers an area of 40,000 hectares and according to legend all forts were interconnected by a network of underground tunnels. Especially interesting is the story according to which Fort Marie Louise at Muzil was connected with the fort on the Brijuni islands by an underwater tunnel.  Pula's fortifications were designed to defend the city from possible attacks from the sea and were built to resist every possible attack - for this reason they were mostly circular or ring-like so that shells could rebound off the walls. They were all built at excellent locations, mostly lookouts that even today offer a magnificent view.  The fortifications of Pula and its surroundings were never used for a specific attack and defense of the city, although according to some sources, in 1915 Pula's garrison consisted of as many as 1,410 officers and over 51 thousand soldiers. Owing to the fact that the forts were never attacked from the sea, today Pula has a completely preserved significant fortification complex. "

Although incomplete, the church is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and in November 2010 was consecrated and proclaimed a minor basilica by Pope Benedict XVI.  Though construction of Sagrada Famlia had commenced in 1882, Gaud became involved in 1883 taking over the project and transforming it with his architectural and engineering stylecombining Gothic and curvilinear Art Nouveau forms.  Gaud devoted his last years to the project, and at the time of his death at age 73 in 1926, less than a quarter of the project was complete. Sagrada Famlia's construction progressed slowly, as it relied on private donations and was interrupted by the Spanish Civil Waronly to resume intermittent progress in the 1950s. Construction passed the midpoint in 2010 with some of the project's greatest challenges remaining and an anticipated completion date of 2026the centennial of Gaud's death. The baslica has a long history of dividing the citizens of Barcelonaover the initial possibility it might compete with Barcelona's cathedral, over Gaud's design itself over the possibility that work after Gaud's death disregarded his design and the recent possibility that an underground tunnel of Spain's high-speed train could disturb its stability.  Describing Sagrada Famlia, art critic Rainer Zerbst said ""it is probably impossible to find a church building anything like it in the entire history of art"" and Paul Goldberger called it ""the most extraordinary personal interpretation of Gothic architecture since the Middle Ages.""  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagrada_Fam%C3%ADlia"

I was going to post an unusual shot of a heron posing as a garden ornament on a flat balcony.  However just as we were heading home I spotted this fire rainbow.  Ive seen it once before and read about them recently.  Technically it is part of a circumhorizontal arc and can only be seen in London between late May and July when the sun is at an elevation of at least 58 degrees and shines through hexagonal ice crystals in high altitude cirrus clouds... boring!   Lets just say fire rainbow and be in awe!

I went on a hike on the path ""cao negro"" which was much longer than epected and in pretty wet conditions. Nonetheless, the hike in new territory seeing and being in a new space is always good for the mind. After my journey to Monteverde, I went to the small town of La Fortuna. On my departing journey from Monteverde, there had to be at least 15 rainbows or ""arcoiris"" ...incredible. The locals there find it comical when others marvel at the rainbows...its a common occurrence in Monteverde...with clear skies and rainbows galore...it set the pace for my descending trip from the cloud forest. La Fortuna's landscape is dominated by Volcn Arenal. I was told 80% of people who visit La Fortuna actually get to see the full view of the volcano as there are too many clouds. I was fotunate to be able to see the whole thing and wow what a sight. If you havent seen a volcano as I hadn't, it is awe inspiring, such a massive feature in the landscape. After sleeping a night, the next day I hiked around the Volcano and got to see a nice view of the valley and Lake. Afterwards in the evening, I went to a natural hotspring river where the water was a pleasantly hot temperature and relaxed."

The bargain being Struck, away he went on his journey with a lick in his hand, which he was to leave there as a tetimony of his performance; at length comeing near the Meer, he heard the lamentable cryes of this ditreed woman, begging for mercy; which at firt put him to a tand; but being a man of great reolution and ome policy, he went boldly on however, counterfeiting the preence of divers other perons, calling Jack, Dick, and Thom, and crying here are the rogues we lookt for, &c. which being heard by the Murderer he left the Woman and fled, whom the other man found by the Meer ide almot tript of her cloaths, arid brought her with him to Leek, as an ample tetimony of his having been at the Meer, and of Gods providence too.   Robert Plot, The Natural History of Staffordshire, Oxford, 1686  THE BLACK MERE OF MORRIDGE, IN THE STAFFORDSHIRE MOORLANDS.   Blake Mere, or Black Mere, is a small pond of irregular shape, lying in a little hollow on the summit of the high hill of Morridge, about three and a half miles E.N.E. from Leek. A visit to it in Summer is pleasant enough, but in Winter, and when the mists of November beset the traveller as he passes the spotwhen the cutting winds howl fiercely through the gloomy heaththe pool, naturally dark, appears black as night, and leads him to term it   That lake, whose gloomy shore  Skylark never warbles oer.  Such, indeed, was the horror in which the Black Mere was held by our ancestors; and such their strange beliefs connected with it, that I have thought it well they should be preserved in the pages of the RELIQUARY. Camden quoting Nicham, says it is   A lake that with prophetic noise doth roar;  Where beasts can neer be made to venture oer  By hounds, or men, or fleeter death pursued,  Theyll not plunge in, but shun the hated flood.   Dr. Plott, however, in his History of Staffordshire, saysThe water of the Black Meer is not so bad as some have fancied, and I take it to be nothing more than such as that in the peat pits, though it be confidently reported that no Cattle will drink of it, no bird light on it, or fly over it; all which are as false as that it is bottomless; it being found upon admeasurement, scarce four yards in the deepest place; my horse also drinking, when I was there, as freely of it as ever I saw him in any other place; and the Fowls are so far from declining to fly over it, that I spoke with several that had seen Geese upon it; so that I take this to be as good as the rest, notwithstanding the vulgar disrepute it lies under.   But this place has yet far more terrible associationsHark! says a manuscript1 now lying before meHark! what a shriek of agony! what an appalling scream; what a soul-sickening note of despair; Heavens; Tis a womans voice that crys so loudly for aid; her very throat seems cracking with the intensity of her efforts. Louder; louder; grows the scream, and then a fearful gurgle, sudden and instant, stays the hideous sound; yet the stillness is more ominous than the hitherto frightful din. Not a sound, not a murmur; the senses stunned and palsied by the piercing cry, are now awe-stricken at the deathlike silence which succeeds But hark; hark; it comes againquick, like a thunder-clap, it is repeated in all its former agony; the air is filled with the re-vibrations of that wild outcry; horribly distinct, the shriek becomes deafening in the extreme. The voice is unansweredno other tongue speaks but that despairing one, yet it cries as though some were near to hear it; it appeals as if those were present who could relieve its terror. Again the cry is suddenly hushed, a confused murmur as of one calling from beneath thick folds of cloth wrapped over the mouth, is heard, and then silence deep and deathlike, prevails. But again; again; the head escapes the barbarous hand; again the mouth is clear, the tongue moves, the shriek is repeated; echo sends back the cry, it resounds from all sides, and the air is fraught with the deafening screamHelp! help! Mercy! mercy! The cries are quickly stifled; the voice is mute; the tongue dumb; yet the hoarse hollow cry once more faintly sounds, and the low, smothered, guttural whisper bears the same burden, Help! help! Mercy! mercy!  0 that the slave had forty thousand lives,  One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.Shakespeare.   This event is thus ably narrated by the venerable historian before quotedAmongst the unusual accidents that have attended the female sex in the course of their lives, I think I may also reckon the narrow escapes they have made from death; whereof I met with one mentioned with admiration by every body at Leek, that happened not far off at the black Meer of Morridg, which, though famous for nothing for which it is commonly reputed, as that it is bottomless; no Cattle will drink of it; or birds fly over, or settle upon it (all which I found to be false), yet it is so for the signal deliverance of a poor woman, enticed hither in a dismal stormy night by a bloody Ruffian, who had first gotten her with child, and intended in this remote, inhospitable place, to have dispatched her by drowning.   The same night (Providence so ordering it), there were several persons of inferior rank drinking in an alehouse2 at Leek, whereof one having been out and observing the darkness and other ill circumstances of the weather, coming in again, said to the rest of his companions, that he were a stout man indeed that would venture to goe to the black Meer of Morridg, in such a night as that; to which one of them replying that for a crown, or some such summe, he would undertake it; the rest, joining their purses, said he should have his demand. The bargain being struck away he went on is journey with a stick in his hand, which he was to leave there as a testimony of his performance. At length, coming near the Meer, he heard the lamentable cries of this distressed woman begging for mercy; which at first put him to a stand, but being a man of great resolution and some policy, he went boldly on, however, counterfeiting the presence of divers other persons, calling Jack, Dick, and Thom, and crying, Here are the rogues we lookd for, which, being heard by the murderer, he left the woman and fled, whom the other man found by the Meer side, almost stript of her clothes, and brought her with him to Leek, as an ample testimony of his having been at the Meer, and of Gods Providence too.   This Meer is also termed the Mermaid Pool, from an old tradition that one of those fabulous creatures dwells in it; in fact, some of the peasants thereabout are ready to swear that when, some years ago the Pool was partially let off, one appeared, predicting that if the water were allowed to escape it would drown all Leek and Leekfrith. This vain idea has given origin to the sign of a neighbouring roadside inn  The Mermaid, a place frequently visited by sportsmen when shooting in the vicinity. "

The lake is about seven times larger than the Dead Sea ofPalestine, and carries about the same per cent of salt. This percent is from 19 to 22, according to the season of the year, andcalculations fix the total of the salt in the lake at four hundredmillion tons. The waters are sluggish and green-hued. Theyare very buoyant, and so clear that the eye can penetrate them togreat depths. Gulls innumerable, whose breeding place is one ofthe eight islands in the lake, frequent the waters, in which nothinglives except a small shrimp.
