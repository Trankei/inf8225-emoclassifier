New days full of eager audiences waiting in breathless anticipation, the bleachers are always full.  Popcorn and cotton candy in the bellies of happy children.  But the arena is empty and the air is stifled with the thick blanket of indifference.  The soil stained with the blood of old soldiers, ghosts of the soulless regime. Intoxicating viewpoints, seducing entire civilizations.  Fallen Angels laughing at collective religious ignorance.Working, striving, accelerating, trying to keep up.  Thank God for the fire, the warmness and contentment.  Images of light coming to meet me.  A happy reunion, a friend long lost, victims of bad timing.  Lonely travels down the forlorn path Antecedents reminding me of how I could have done it better.  For the only way out is up and the only way up is through the fire.  Redwood trees and granite lead the way though it hardly seems real.  Watching in hiding, listening to the maddening sound of their voices singing through the air, shrill and hollow.  Singing a song about me.  Dancing naked knee deep in my blood.  Ruthless killers couldnt do better this,  though that is of little comfort now. Biting at the heels of contentment, Energy made manifest, seems like matter has betrayed universal law  Im not really sure what that means.  Probably nothing of consequence. Generations lamentations, devastations, spasmodic earth ever changing, rearranging, decks of cards not in order.  Chaotic scrimmages fighting against an invisible enemy steadily marching forward, never looking back.  Steady streams of malcontent effortlessly winding down the forlorn path.  Writhing under the pressure of time, withering bloody corpses of yesterday, today, tomorrow.  Existence as we know it ceases without warning, followed by evolutions, revolutions, new species doomed to repeat our past.  "

Just hours before, I was lying on my blankets, looking up at the night sky twinkling full of stars. We were on a camel safari in the desert, and all around our little camp was barren, dry land. Far away, I could see the sun creeping up slowly above the horizon...and then I felt an intangible kind of contentment creeping up slowly within me. It isn't everyday that one gets to sit quietly in the middle of a vast desert land, and enjoy the view of the sun rising. I marvelled at how sunrises and sunsets could conjure up such a deep sense of meaning to my life...and then I took a picture, to have a snapshot of this moment for everytime I feel that life lacks meaning."

Sam will be undergoing surgery on May 15th and there is a chance he may not wake up from the anesthesia, mostly because he is so old. But we have put it off long enough and his quality of life will be so much better if he does make it, and we hope he does (of course).   When I asked the vet, ""what happens when he comes through the surgery -- what then?""  she answered, ""Well, then Sam lives happily ever after.""  heh.  Well, I hope and pray that's the case.   I will be with him every minute of the surgery, holding his paw, stroking his head, talking to him (nonverbally) even though he'll be asleep and he's deaf anyway. I would not be able to say yes to this surgery unless I could be there.   So ... we are having him clipped a little earlier than usual, and since this may be his last spring with his silky long(ish) shiny black and gray coat, I took a ton of photos of him just now.   Just now, he is out in a van that comes to our house to be clipped and groomed.  Sam always looks like an embarrassed lab after his spring clipping but he's way more comfortable. I'll post some pics maybe tomorrow of the short-coated retriever, Sam.   up close, more personal  ;-D"

Still, I move my pencil across the page as I sit at my porch-desk-sanctuary.  It glides, nurtures  wonders. Up, down  I see it, I notice. It blends.  I notice the sounds as the occur around me.  Bird song. Jay squawk.   Cars tires woosh. Airplane pushing the air  aside, pummeling its way through the once still  sky vapors bullying towards the airport. Lawn  mower, too loud. A second lawn mower  or  is it leaf blower? Too loud.  I wish the noises (except for the birds)  would just cut it out.  Stop already.  I need to stay home, work, write, be.  I notice Joel drive past, slightly late to work again.  A ridiculously loud bird. Sheesh. The  thing is screeching.  The tree in front of me attracts me, calls me towards it. I pick up my ever present  camera to hold my witness of it in  image form, to be revisited as desired.   I snap. And snap. And snap. Different angles,  different light, I see the tears on the side of the tree. My heart responds, differently now.  I realize without realizing that it has been divinity, calling me.  Silence falls. I hear the unusual, gravelly lusty bird call and photograph the black birds, flirting as they sit on a branch of my palm tree.  I photograph the pine tree, bleeding, in the  places where its limbs were severed to keep Sam safe. I look up into the tree heart and notice,  suddenly, it is no longer hot. The wind is blowing, gently.  The pine needles sing gratitude.  I smile, contentment filling my lips as they turn up just slightly. My heart joins my lips in a knowing smile.  I move to my desk to write.  The birds sing, more melodiously, it seems.  I listen. The sound fills me with gratitude now  that I spent just a flash of an eternal moment,  draped in silence. All the while, I am guessing,  the lawn mowers were blaring and the vehicles were driving by and all the extra stuff  was making noise.  I wished, in writing, for the noises to go away.  That wish opened the door to my wish being granted,  my request being received with intense passion.   My Mirado black warrior leaves hearts on the page.

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. Allahs peace be upon Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W), the glorious Prophet of Islam, and on his Companions and his followers.   TASAWWUF ""There is no doubt that Tasawwuf is an important branch of Islam. The word itself may have been derived form the Arabic word ""Soof"" (Wool) or from ""Safa"" (cleanliness), but its foundation lies in ones personal sincerity in seeking Allahs nearness and trying to live a life pleasing to Him. Study of the Quran, the Hadith, and the practical life of the holy Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) and his faithful Companions provide unmistakable support to this reality."" (Hazrat Moulana Allah Yar Khan (R.A)  SUFISM, AN ESSENTIAL PART OF ISLAM Doubts exist not only in the minds of the Muslim faithful but also among the Ulema, notably the exoteric about Tasawwuf and its votaries. Often they lead to misunderstanding, as if Shariah and Tariqah were two separate entries, or that Tasawwuf was some obscure discipline foreign to Islam, or that it was altogether above the established laws and injunctions of our Religion. To help remove these misgivings and to reassure seekers, as well as scholars, our Sheikh Hazrat Moulana Allah Yar Khan (R.A), Sheikh Silsila Naqshbandia Awaisia, wrote Al-Jamal Wal Kamal, Aqaid-O-Kamalaat Ulmai-e-Deoband, Binat-e-Rasool (S.A.W), Daamad-e-Ali (R.A), Dalael-us-Salook, Ejaad-e-Mazhab Shia, Hayat-un-Nabi (S.A.W), Hayat Barzakhia, Ilm-o-Irfan, Niffaz-e-Shariat Aur Fiqah-e-Jaferia, Saif-e-Owaisi, Shikast-e-Ahdai Hussain and Tahkeek Halal Haram books.  BIOGRAPHY Sheikh Allah Yar Khan was born in Chakrala, a remote village of Mianwali District of Pakistan, in 1904. He completed his religious education in 1934. The very year, he met Shaykh Abdul Rahim, who took him to the shrine of Shaykh Allah Deen Madni. By Divine Will his spiritual connection was right away established with the saint of the 10th century Hijra (sixteenth century) and he started receiving spiritual beneficence. His sublime education in Sufism, signifying progressive spiritual growth and advancement, continued for about twenty-five years. In 1962 he was directed to carry out the propagation of Prophetic blessings - a noble mission that he accomplished with singular enthusiasm and devotion for a period spanning half a century. Anybody who visited him was duly rewarded with a share of spiritual bliss as per his/her sincerity and capacity. Shaykh Allah Yar Khan's mission produced men and women of deep spiritual vision and distinction.  Although Hazrat Moulana Allah Yar Khan (R.A) have lived a major portion of his life as a scholar, with the avowed mission of illuminating the truth of Islam and the negation of fallacious sects, and this would appear quite removed from Tasawwuf, yet the only practical difference between the two, namely the use of the former as a media to expound the truth, and the latter to imbue people with positive faith. Nevertheless, people are amazed that a man, who until the other day, was known as a dialectician and a preacher of Islam, is not only talking of Mystic Path, but is also claiming spiritual bonds with the veteran Sufi Masters of the Past. This amazement is obviously out of place in the view of Quranic injunction: This is the bounty of Allah which He gives to whom He wills. (62:4)  THE PURIFICATION OF THE SOUL The purification of the soul always formed part of the main mission of the Prophets; that is, the dissemination and propagation of the Devine Message. This responsibility later fell directly on the shoulders of the true Ulema in the Ummah of the last Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W), who, as his genuine successors, have continued to shed brave light in every Dark Age of materialism and sacrilege. In the present age of ruinous confusion, the importance of this responsibility has increased manifold; of the utter neglect of Islam by Muslims has not only driven them to misery, but also grievously weakened their bonds of faith in Allah and His Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W). The decay in their belief and consequent perversion in their conduct has reached a stage that any attempt to pull them out of the depth of ignominy and the heedless chaos of faithlessness, attracts grave uncertainties and apprehensions rather than a encouraging will to follow the Shariah, to purify the soul and to reform within. The Quranic Verse: Layers upon layers of darkness (24:40) provides the nearest expression of their present state.  SHARIAH & SUFISM Any action against the Sunnah (Prophets way of life) cannot be called Sufism. Singing and dancing, and the prostration on tombs are not part of Sufism. Nor is predicting the future and predicting the outcome of cases in the courts of law, a part of Sufism. Sufis are not required to abandon their worldly possessions or live in the wilderness far from the practical world. In fact these absurdities are just its opposites. It is an established fact that Tazkiyah (soul purification) stands for that inner purity which inspires a persons spirit to obey the holy Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W). If a false claimant of Sufism teaches tricks and jugglery, ignoring religious obligations, he is an impostor. A true Sheikh will lead a believer to the august spiritual audience of the holy Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W). If you are fortunate enough to be blessed with the company of an accomplished spiritual guide and Sheikh of Sufism, and if you follow his instructions, you will observe a positive change in yourself, transferring you from vice to virtue.  ISLAM, AS A COMPLETE CODE OF LIFE Islam, as a complete code of life or Deen, was perfected during the life of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W). He was the sole teacher and his mosque was the core institution for the community. Although Islam in its entirety was practiced during that blessed era, the classification and compilation of its knowledge into distinct branches like Tafsir (interpretation of the Quran), Hadith (traditions or sayings of the holy Prophet- SAWS), Fiqh (Islamic law), and Sufism (the soul purification) were undertaken subsequently. This Deen of Allah passed from the holy Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) to his illustrious Companions in two ways: the outward and the inward. The former comprised the knowledge defined by speech and conduct, i.e., the Quran and Sunnah. The latter comprised the invisible blessings or the Prophetic lights transmitted by his blessed self. These blessings purified the hearts and instilled in them a passionate desire to follow Islam with utmost love, honesty and loyalty.  WHATS SUFISM Sufism is the attempt to attain these Barakah (Blessings). The Companions handed down Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) teachings as well as blessings to the Tabaeen. Their strong hearts were capable of infusing these blessings into the hearts of their followers. Both aspects of Islam were similarly passed on by the Tabaeen to the Taba Tabaeen. The compilation of knowledge and its interpretation led to the establishment of many schools of religious thought; famous four being the Hanafi, the Hanbali, the Maliki, and the Shafa'i, all named after their founders. Similarly, in order to acquire, safeguard and distribute his blessings, an organized effort was initiated by four schools of Sufism: The Naqshbandia, the Qadria, the Chishtia, and the Suharwardia. These schools were also named after their organizers and came to be known as Sufi Orders. All these Orders intend to purify the hearts of sincere Muslims with Prophetic lights. These Sufi Orders also grew into many branches with the passage of time and are known by other names as well. The holy Quran has linked success in this life and the Hereafter with Tazkiyah (soul purification). He, who purified, is successful. (87: 14) Sufi Orders of Islam are the institutions where the basics of Tazkiyah (soul purification) and its practical application are taught. They have graded programs in which every new seeker is instructed in Zikr-e Lisani (oral Zikr) and is finally taught the Zikr-e Qalbi (Remembrance in heart).  ZIKR-E QALBI However, in the Naqshbandia Order, Zikr-e Qalbi is practiced from the very beginning. Adherence to the Sunnah (Prophets way of life) is greatly emphasized in this Order, because the seeker achieves greater and quicker progress through its blessings. The essence of Zikr is that the Qalb should sincerely accept Islamic beliefs and gain the strength to follow the Sunnah with even greater devotion. If the heart is acquainted with Allah and is engaged in His Zikr; then it is filled with Barakaat-e Nabuwwat (Prophetic blessings) which infuse their purity in the mind and body. This not only helps in controlling sensual drives but also removes traces of abhorrence, voracity, envy and insecurity from human soul. The person therefore becomes an embodiment of love, both for the Divine and the corporeal. This is the meaning of a Hadith, There is a lump of flesh in the human body; if it goes astray the entire body is misguided, and if it is reformed the entire body is reformed. Know that this lump is the Qalb.  PAS ANFAS Recent History Khawajah Naqshband (d. 1389 CE) organized the Naqshbandia Order at Bukhara (Central Asia). This Order has two main branches  the Mujaddidia and the Owaisiah. The former is identified with Sheikh Ahmed Sirhindi, known as Mujaddid Alif Sani (literally: reviver of the second Muslim millennium), a successor to Khawajah Baqi Billah, who introduced the Order to the Indo- Pakistan sub-continent. The Owaisiah Order employs a similar method of Zikr but acquires the Prophetic blessings in the manner of Khawajah Owais Qarni, who received this beneficence from the Holy Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) without a formal physical meeting. The Zikr employed by the Naqshbandia is Zikr-e Khafi Qalbi (remembrance of Allahs Name within the heart) and the method is termed Pas Anfas, which (in Persian) means guarding every breath. The Chain of Transmission of these Barakah, of course, emanates from the holy Prophet- SAWS.  SPIRITUAL BAIAT (OATH OF ALLEGIANCE It is necessary in all Sufi Orders that the Sheikh and the seekers must be contemporaries and must physically meet each other for the transfer of these blessings. However, the Naqshbandia Owaisiah Order goes beyond this requirement and Sufis of this Order receive these Barakah regardless of physical meeting with their Sheikh or even when the Sheikh is not their contemporary. Yet, it must be underscored that physical meeting with the Sheikh of this Order still holds great importance in dissemination of these Barakah. Sheikh Sirhindi writes about the Owaisiah Order in his book Tazkirah: It is the most sublime, the most exalted, and the most effectiveand the highest station of all others is only its stepping stone. By far the greatest singular distinction of the Naqshbandia Owaisiah Order is the honor of Spiritual Baiat (Oath of Allegiance) directly at the blessed hands of the holy Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W).  SHEIKH HAZRAT MOULANA ALLAH YAR KHAN (R.A) The Reviver Sheikh Allah Yar Khan was born in Chikrala, a remote village of Mianwali District of Pakistan, in 1904. He completed his religious education in 1934. The same year, he met Sheikh Abdul Rahim, who took him to the shrine of Sheikh Allah Deen Madni. By Divine Will his spiritual connection was immediately established with the saint of the 10th century Hijra (sixteenth century CE) and he started receiving spiritual beneficence.

Anybody who visited him was duly rewarded with a share of spiritual bliss commensurate with his/her sincerity and capacity. Sheikh Allah Yar Khans mission produced men and women of deep spiritual vision and eminence. He authored eighteen books, the most distinguished being Dalael us-Sulook (Sufism - An Objective Appraisal), Hayat-e Barzakhiah (Life Beyond Life) and Israr ul- Haramain (Secrets of the two holy Mosques). He was undoubtedly one of the most distinguished Sufi saints of the Muslim Ummah and a reviver of the Naqshbandia Owaisiah Order. He passed away on 18 February 1984 in Islamabad at the age of eighty.  THE CHAIN OF TRANSMISSION OF NAQSHBANDIA OWAISIAH 1. Hazrat Muhammad ur-Rasool Allah (Sall Allah-o Alaihi wa Sallam), 2. Hazrat Abu Bakr Siddiq (Radhi Allah-o Unho), 3. Hazrat Imam Hassan Basri (Rahmat Ullah Alaihi), 4. Hazrat Daud Tai (Rahmat Ullah Alaihi), 5. Hazrat Junaid Baghdadi (Rahmat Ullah Alaihi), 6. Hazrat Ubaid Ullah Ahrar (Rahmat Ullah Alaihi), 7. Hazrat Abdur Rahman Jami (Rahmat Ullah Alaihi), 8. Hazrat Abu Ayub Muhammad Salih (Rahmat Ullah Alaihi), 9. Hazrat Allah Deen Madni (Rahmat Ullah Alaihi), 10. Hazrat Moulana Allah Yar Khan (Rahmat Ullah Alaihi).  THE SPIRIT OR RUH The spirit or Ruh of every person is a created reflection of the Divine Attributes and it originates in Alam-e Amar (Realm of Command). Its food is the Light of Allah or the Divine Refulgence, which it acquires from the Realm of Command through the holy Prophet Muhammad (may Allahs choicest favors and peace be upon him), whose status in the spiritual world is like that of the sun in the solar system. The Quran refers to him as the bright lamp. Indeed, he is the divinely selected channel of all Barakah. All Exalted Messengers themselves receive these Barakah from him.  LATAIF The human Ruh also possesses vital organs like the physical body; through which it acquires its knowledge, food and energy. These are called Lataif (singular Latifah: subtlety). Scholars of various Sufi Orders have associated them with specific areas of the human body. The Naqshbandia Owaisiah Order identifies these Lataif as follows. First - Qalb: This spiritual faculty is located within the physical heart. Its function is Zikr. Its strength increases ones capacity for Allahs Zikr. Second  Ruh: The site of this Latifah, which is a distinct faculty of the human Ruh, is on the right side of the chest at the level of Qalb. Its primary function is concentration towards Allah. Third  Sirri: This is located above the Qalb and functions to make possible Kashf. Forth  Khaffi: This is located above the Ruh and functions to perceive the omnipresence of Allah. Fifth  Akhfa: This is located in the middle of chest, at the centre of the first four Lataif and makes it possible for the Ruh to perceive the closeness of Allah, Who is closer to us than our own selves. Sixth  Nafs: This Latifah is located at the forehead and functions to purify the human soul. Seventh  Sultan al-Azkar: This Latifah is located at the top centre of the head and serves to absorb the Barakah of Allah into the entire body, so that every cell resonates with Zikr.  FIVE EXALTED MESSENGERS OF GOD There are Five Exalted Messengers among the many known and unknown Messengers of Allah. They are Hazrat Muhammad, Hazrat Nuh (Noah), Hazrat Ibrahim (Abraham), Hazrat Musa (Moses), and Hazrat Esa (Jesus), peace be upon them all. Hazrat Adam is the first Prophet of Allah and the father of mankind. Each Latifah is associated with a particular Prophet. The Barakah and lights from Hazrat Adam (peace be upon him), descend on the first Latifah Qalb; its lights are reflected from the first heaven and are yellowish. The second Latifah is associated with Hazrat Nuh and Hazrat Ibrahim (peace be upon them). Its lights descend from the second heaven and appear as golden red. The lights descending upon the third Latifah are from Hazrat Musa (peace be upon him) and are white. One the fourth Latifah, the lights of Hazrat Esa (peace be upon him) descend from the fourth heaven and are deep blue. The fifth Latifah receives its Barakah directly from the holy Prophet Muhammad (may Allahs choicest favors and peace be upon him). The lights associated with this Latifah are green, descend from the fifth heaven, and overwhelm all the first four Lataif. The Lights descending upon the sixth and seventh Lataif are the Divine Lights, whose color and condition cannot be determined. These are like flashes of lightening that defy comprehension. If Allah blesses a seeker with Kashf, he can observe all of this. The vision is slightly diffused in the beginning, but gradually the clarity improves.  SULOOK Stages of the Path After all seven Lataif of a seeker have been illuminated with Divine Lights through Tawajjuh of the Sheikh and his Ruh has acquired the ability to fly, the Sheikh initiates its journey on the sublime Path of Divine nearness. The Path is known as Sulook, and its stages are not hypothetical imaginations but real and actually existing stations on the spiritual Path. These are also referred to as Meditations, because a seeker mentally meditates about a station while his/her Ruh actually ascends towards it. The first three stations that form the base of whole Sulook are described as; Ahadiyyat, a station of Absolute Unity of Divinity. It is above and beyond the seven heavens. It is so vast a station that the seven heavens and all that they encompass are lost within Ahadiyyat as a ring is lost in a vast desert. Its lights are white in color. Maiyyat station denotes Divine Company, He is with you, wherever you might be. This station is so vast that Ahadiyyat along with the seven heavens beneath are lost within it as a ring is lost in a desert. Its lights are green in color. Aqrabiyyat station denotes Divine Nearness, He is nearer to you than your life- vein. Again, Aqrabiyyat is vast as compared to Maiyyat in the same proportion. Its lights are golden red and are reflected from the Divine Throne. It is indeed the greatest favor of Almighty Allah that He blesses a seeker with an accomplished Sheikh, who takes him to these sublime stations. The final station that a seeker attains to during his/her lifetime becomes his/her Iliyyeen (blessed abode) in Barzakh and his/her Ruh stays at this station after death.   ZIKR Why is Zikr Necessary for Everyone? Allah ordains every soul in the Quran to Perform Zikr. This not only means reciting the Quran and Tasbeeh but also Zikr-e Qalb. It is only through Zikr-e Qalbi that Prophetic Lights reach the depths of human soul and purify it from all vice and evil. Zikr infuses a realization of constant Divine Presence and a seeker feels great improvement in the level of sincerity and love towards Allah and the holy Prophet- SAWS. Such levels of sincerity, love and feelings of Divine Presence can never be obtained without Zikr. It would be a mistake to believe that Zikr may be a requirement only for the very pious and virtuous people. Zikr provides the Prophetic blessings which are in effect the life line of every human soul. It transforms even the most corrupted humans into virtuous souls by bringing out the best in them. The fact is that Zikr is the only way to achieve true contentment and satisfaction in life. The holy Quran has pointed to this eternal fact that it is only through Zikr Allah that hearts can find satisfaction. Such satisfaction and peace are the ultimate requirements of every person, regardless of religion, race and ethnicity. Practicing Zikr regularly removes all traces of anxiety and restlessness, and guides the human soul to eternal bliss and peace.  KHALIFA MAJAZEEN Hazrat Moulana Allah Yar Khan (R.A), during his life time in 1974, presented a nomination list to Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W), during Maraqba, of expected Khalifa Majazeen for Silsila Naqshbandia Awaisia. Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) approved some names, deleted some of the names, and added down the name of Major Ghulam Muhammad as also Khalifa Majaaz of Silsila Naqshbandia Awaisia (which was not previously included in the list)  The approved names at that time included:  1. Mr. Muhammad Akram Awan Sahib,  2. Mr. Sayed Bunyad Hussain Shah Sahib,  3. Mr. Major Ahsan Baig Sahib,  4. Mr. Col. Matloob Hussain Sahib,  5. Mr. Major Ghulam Muhammad Sahib of Wan Bhachran Mianwali,  6. Mr. Molvi Abdul Haq Sahib,  7. Mr. Hafiz Abdul Razzaq Sahib,  8. Mr. Hafiz Ghulam Qadri Sahib,  9. Mr. Khan Muhammad Irani Sahib,  10. Mr. Maolana Abdul Ghafoor Sahib,  11. Mr. Syed Muhammad Hassan Sahib of Zohb.  These Majazeen were authorized to; held Majalis of Zikar (Pas Anfas) in their respective areas, arrange Majalis of Zikar in neighboring areas, train them on the way of Sulook, prepare them for Spiritual Baiat (Oath of Allegiance), and present them to Sheikh Hazrat Moulana Allah Yar Khan for Spiritual Baiat at the Hand of Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W), in the life of Hazrat Moulana Allah Yar Khan (R.A), and were all equal in status as Khalifa Majaaz of Hazrat Moulana Allah Yar Khan (R.A).  Presently we are following Hazrat Major  Ghulam Muhammad Sahib, Khalifa Majaaz of Hazrat Moulana Allah Yar Khan (R.A). "

They reside in rude cottages, it is true, anddo not enjoy the same elegancies of life which are obtained in manyother industrial pursuits ; but they have abundance to eat, goodclothes to wear, and money in their pockets.

The plaque next to the sculpture reads: The Canadian Embassy is proud to be the home of Haida artist Bill Reid's largest and most complex work of sculpture:  a bronze-cast sculpture of a canoe containing thirteen mythological Haida figures.  Among the creatures and humans represented are the Raven, the trickster of the Northwest Coast, holding the steering oar; under his tail is the Mouse Woman, the traditional guide to travellers between the human and non-human realms of Haida myth.  In the bow is the Grizzly Bear; paddling on the port side is his human wife, the Bear Mother.  Between them are their children, the Two Cubs.  Behind the Bear Mother is the Beaver, an uncle of the Raven, who hoarded all the fresh water and fish in the world.  Behind him is the Dogfish Woman, a shape-changing creature, part human and part shark.  Across from the Bear Mother is the Eagle.  Beneath him, perched on the gunwale, is the Frog.  Arched across the centre of the canoe is the Wolf, with his claws in the Beaver's back and his teeth in the Eagle's wings.  Behind the shoulders of the Wolf is a human paddler whom Reid calls ""the Ancient Reluctant Conscript.""  At the centre of this menagerie stands the shaman, known in Haida as the ""Kilstlaai.""  His robe and staff, sculpture withinh sculpture, portray the Seabear, the Raven and the Killer Whale - allusions to other stories central to the Haida view of the world.  The canoe contains both Raven and Eagle - the two sides of the Haida social order; women and men, a rich man and a poorer man, animals and human beings:  Not all is peace and contentment in this crowded boat, but whatever their differences, they are paddling together, in one boat, headed in one direction.  Wherever their journey takes them, let us wish them luck."

I got my iPhone several months back, after much foot dragging and mindful consideration --  and I loved it right away.  But I didn't start using Instagram and I thought I might not ever start.  It is, of course, largely to do with the way that all these new media tools can eat away at our time and our concentration and our presence with the people we love.  I believe, as Sue Atchley Ebaugh says, that ""the greatest gift we can give one another is rapt attention to one another's existence"" -- and I want to give that to my child, my husband, my home.  I am also concerned that by ceaselessly sharing the (beloved) minutae of my life, I might cease actually living it.  How, also, do all these tools which offer, among so many other wonderful things, such regular validation and immediate gratification get in the way of a deeper, harder won, more enduring contentment?  I can't stop thinking about Ma Ingalls.  Surely, surely, she would have liked a sister or aunt or neighbor closeby -- some grown woman to talk to, to cook with, to help birth her babies, to ruminate on parenting or relationship challenges with.  But she didn't have that, and she did build a solid, joyful life with her family.  So.  I am still thinking about all that.  But I have also started using Instagram and I am having a lot of fun.  I don't think I have the words yet for why -- maybe those among y'all who are using it too can articulate?"

Following the road to grasp something, a thing, anything, brings me to the technique  of comparing. As soon as I compare it with the environment, I can allocate it, so that  this thing, something, anything, fits into my world which I build up,  my picture, construct,  my idea of life in which I live, which I must live within.  So everyone creates  their own puzzle, whilst strolling along the alley of time, and the pieces  one gets to see, do influence the big picture.  But how to get a nice, friendly  and warm idea of this world? How to get an episteme,  in which even contentment feels welcome and starts to settle down?  Let me whisper now: The angle it is, which does the trick. Not what, but how you see, can make the difference.

Daman was the battleground to oust the Portuguese and had witnessed many a wars waged against the alien powers. It had been a melting pot where races and cultures met and mixed to bring forth a multicoloured identity.

I make no attempt to conceal my inner freak do I?  But this one...  I've been grappling with for a little while.  I need your help.  I don't know what to make of this.  It's that I've been having this recurring dream.  It's so vivid and real.  I wake up remembering the colors and the textures.  Even the smells and the tastes.  I've been having it for about six months I think.  You know I really like spicy foods.  The hotter the better.  And I love me some really good chili.  I've talked to my dog about this dream and she listens so intently.  Her brow furrows and she does that head tilt.  But that's all she's got for me.  Well...  in my dream there's this pipeline that brings chili to the United States from Canada.  Just like a pipeline that carries oil.  Only this pipeline is pumping lots of chili from the great north.  I don't know why I dream about the 'Chili Pipeline' but I do.  In the dream I've found this place...  where the pipeline comes above ground...  and there's this valve that doesn't have a lock on it...  I go there and I fill buckets up with this chili and I share it with my friends.  It's not great chili...  I'm always addin' spices and stuff to it...  then it's great chili.  What in the hell does this dream mean?  Everytime I go to the 'Chili Pipeline' I see people from the past... friends of mine that just happen to be walkin' by the 'Chili Pipeline' that day.  Inevitably they're wearing the clothes I saw them in last.  I'm always happy to point out that they can score some chili there too.  Usually after I spice up the chili we sit down and eat some and talk about old times.  The dream is almost always the same.  The people I encounter in it are different.  It's not like I'm chili deficient in my life.  I make chili whenever I want.  Great chili.  In the crock pot.  Just the way I like it.  There's no shortage of chili in my life.  The dream's not filling a void in that way.  I share chili with my friends on occasion.  I'm totally cognizant that I've created the 'Chili Pipeline' in my subconscious.  I've always believed that dreams are our subconscious trying to cope with something or trying to convey some message to us.  Obviously I have some pretty strange dreams.  Most of them I can pretty easily figure out the meaning of.  Most of them don't recur though either.  I need your help.  I'm reaching out to the flickrverse with this one.  What does the 'Chili Pipeline' mean?  Why is my subconscious using the 'Chili Pipeline' to convey some message to me?  It's not an unpleasant dream.  Although some of my friends don't think it's a good idea for me to be tappin' the 'Chili Pipeline.'  Most of them are just happy to see me and share some chili with me.  last night as I tapped the 'Chili Pipeline' I did it in a canoe.  The weird thing was that I paddled the canoe down the street... not in the water.  Like everytime I have the 'Chili Pipeline' dream I woke up laughing.  The 'street canoe' was just another funny aspect of it.  But as the morning wore on I wondered what it meant.  Maybe I better tell the good doctor about the 'Chili Pipeline.'  I'd just hate to have my shrink think I'm crazy you know?  Maybe you guys can help me figure out what it means?  The Chile Song

Seneca   Garth wrote, ""The way to find out about happiness is to keep your mind on those moments when you feel most happy, when you are really happy  not excited, not just thrilled, but deeply happy. This requires a little bit of self-analysis. What is it that makes you happy? Stay with it, no matter what people tell you. This is what is called following your bliss ... If you do follow your bliss you put yourself on a kind of track that has been there all the while, waiting for you, and the life that you ought to be living is the one you are living ... Follow your bliss and the universe will open doors for you where there were only walls.""  I have always been most content when I was out in the country roaming and exploring. It is for this reason that I was able to take steps to follow my career across this massive and magnificient country I call home. My gran always noted I had the soul of a gypsy. My contentment is always multiplied when I share that time with someone who I care about. This most recent work trip gave me the chance to indulge in several of my passions as I explored new roads through rural Quebec with my wife and my camera as my companions. Along the road, I came across a small herd of horses and ponies in what could only be a recently opened pasture. This little white pony was kind enough to pose for me when I pulled over to get the shot."

The smell of fresh rubber high in my nostrils as I ventured to the edge of the weed covered viewpoint and planted my leather clad derriere on a patch of short cropped grass to savour the beauty before me.  Man and machine bathing in the midday sun as Mother nature enveloped within her arms and soothed away my cares and woes, my aches and pains, my self doubt and inner angst.  This was home to me,  where my heart and soul roamed as free as the birds flying high above me,  my little patch of Utopia that made a sense of it all,  gave me peace and harmony,  direction and purpose.

The one thing I've drawn out is the handkerchief, to keep your eye interested. Without it, the picture turns dull.  ______________  They called it the Wild West on account of the relative sense of lawlessness coupled with a sense of vast opportunity. Seemingly limitless resources, coupled with Manifest Destiny, meant America was a land of grand dreams and unrealized potential.  But with differing goals, shared immediate resources, and unknown future resources, it became apparent that daily interactions and the small community values you could touch and feel were all you could trust. As the world opened up, people must have had the impression that nothing would ever be the same again; that the old laws and ways didn't - simply couldn't - apply. This was a Wild West won not quickly, but slowly, by people with vision, a propensity for structure, and a sense of the importance of motivating communities and the individuals that comprise them.  There are those who posit that we are destined to repeat history. And among them, there are those who posit that it's not that we have more or less to work with in any given period than in another. Rather, it's just that we allocate our resources differently.   In some periods, they say, we put our assets, our time, our energy toward discovery and innovating. In others, we recognize that we've pushed beyond our ability to effectively manage all that's occurring - that the proportion of excitement around the New has become so large that, while exciting,life becomes complex and the hope that discovery once inspired becomes both more frequently realized and less frequently enjoyed. And so we circle the wagons, slow the rate of new idea generation, take inventory, and begin to put structure around all the things we know. An Age of certainty and clear goals takes shape.   Eventually, once we have structure, we feel contentment and begin to use our resources in a third way: we start harvesting existing ideas (BCG might call this a Cash Cow period), and aggregating, and building into a new creative phase, becoming excited again about the possibilities ahead.  This pattern - a cycle of innovation and discovery, then building structure to incorporate the New, then expanded resource usage - occurs repeatedly. We even have inspiring names for periods gone by: The Renaissance, The Age of Enlightenment, The Industrial Age, The Wild West.  All this is fine and dandy, but what most intrigues me is that, for all our advancement through the Ages, it never gets easier, because the line between Quotidien and Wild is ever further; the line between Normal and Crazy ever blurrier. In the same way that, as a sphere expands, the volume required to increase its diameter increases, the more we discover, the harder it is to generate proportionally equal impact. To use an old saw, the greater the giants upon whose shoulders we build, the greater the insight required to become a giant of future generations.  So why do we even bother? Is it that we strive for something more than we see around us? Or is it that we don't see an alternative to achieving?   Personally, I'd bet on the later. You might say we owe it to our descendants and our forefathers/mothers, and you might think we kinda-sorta owe it to ourselves, but when it comes down to it, we don't really have an alternative to achieving. What else can we do but use what we have? And, by definition, using what we have requires action. Action involves change. Change requires vision. Vision involves inspiration. And, well, there you are at the basis for movement through the different periods. "

Every writer on Indian sport begins his chapter onthe bison with the emphatic assertion that he is thefinest specimen of the genus Bos in the world ; andno one who knows this grand animal will dispute theassertion. The name bison, by which he is univer-sally known in India, is of course a glaring misnomer,for he does not belong to the bisontine group, the onlyEastern representative of which is the yak (Bosg-runniens). He falls under the taurine sub-divisionof the genus Bos, which is distinguished from thebisontine sub-division chief   Note About Images Please note that these images are extracted from scanned page images that may have been digitally enhanced for readability - coloration and appearance of these illustrations may not perfectly resemble the original work."

I had the pleasure of shooting with some amazing photographers and all-around wonderful people that day. We walked and shot for three hours, then a bunch of us headed to lunch to end a fantastic morning.  I've been incredibly busy the past couple of weeks and this week will be as bad or worse. The entire weekend was fantastic, but left no time for doing the necessities around the house and not much computer time.   I'm not super thrilled with this, but it's a selfie and it's week 35, and I just need to move on to something else that's more pressing. Like hemming my son's ROTC uniform pants {sigh}. I may not make it to your streams tonight, but I will work to catch up with your lovely and inspiring work.  For Me Again Monday. The theme this week was dreams and I was just stumped for an idea. If I would have thought about it ahead of time, I went to a ""girls' night out"" on Wednesday and we met at the studio of one of my friends. If I had thought about it, I would have taken my SP there because having a studio has been a huge dream of mine all the way back since high school. So, I didn't play the theme this week.

I wasn't 100% sure that I was going to make it after working both jobs on Friday, but on the other hand I didn't want to waste a minute of the fabulous weather we are having here at the moment.   As it turned out I managed to get myself up an out of bed in the morning and make it out there to meet them. And I am so glad I did!! It was an absolutely fantastic day of hiking, climbing and lots of shooting!! I met Sam Fowler, John Cousert and Paul Ciura at the park. We all did a lot of experimenting with OCF and I think they're all hooked on selfies now! I totally love that!  After shooting for a good part of the day, we decided to stay for burgers, beer and a lot of ""shop talk."" Sam, John and Paul, thank you all for a great day out! You are a great group to shoot with, so willing to share, so patient and such a pleasure to hang out with!   For anyone reading, if you don't belong to any local photowalk groups, I would highly encourage you to search one/some out, either here or on Facebook. I bet you'll find something. If you don't find one, start one! Build it and they will come! Seriously! Joining this group and going to my first photowalk has enhanced not only my photography, but I can say it has enhanced my life as well!  I seem to be all about the locations for a while now with my weekly selfies. That wasn't an intentional decision, not that I don't like it. I'll have to try changing things up for next week!  Happy Me Again Monday!!  On BigHugeLabs' black.    "

He told me he was from the city of Marseille. His daughter still lives in France. He is in Ireland for the past 10 years having worked for 5 years in the fishing industry in Donegal before the downturn. Despite an apparent loneliness from family he is happy with his lot. Louis as from the photo is holding Rosary beads in his hand. He face is bright and a picture of contentment. For a few minutes we were both at peace with the world.

It refers to your contentment with what you already have and where you are in life. On the other hand, the dream may be compensatory and implies that you may not be getting enough love in your life. We naturally long for the sense to belong and to be accepted.  To see a couple in love indicates success ahead for you. To see a lover in your dream, symbolizes acceptance, self-worth, and acknowledgement of your true inner value. You are integrating aspects of the masculine and the feminine. As a result, you are feeling complete and whole.Alternatively, your dream lover may also be someone who is your ideal. To see a couple in love indicates success ahead for you.

Unfortunately, though, last night as we were getting ready for bed, Mushu started doing her crazy sneezing thing again, which must mean that there is still something in her sinus cavity that is bothering her.  She has another week of the zithromax and we have a follow-up appointment with the surgeon on Friday 1/6.  Her runny eye has stopped, as well as her runny nose.  I'm thinking of having Elliott ask at the appointment whether we can keep Mushu on the antibiotics a little while longer to make sure the symptoms go away.  In the meantime, our apartment is like a pharmacy in the morning when I'm preparing their breakfast.  This is everything that Mushu gets to help her immune system:  -Acidophilus to replace the good bacteria that the antibiotic is wiping out -Lysine -Vitamin C -Homemade powder mix from Anitra Frazier's book (bonemeal, leichtin granules, wheatbran, seaweed powder)  Once a week, on Sundays, I also give them Vitamin A, D and E.  It was very scary when Mushu's nose was all plugged up and she wasn't eating.  I would really like to get all of this under control with the course of antibiotics and then be able to maintain things with all of the other stuff that I am giving to them.    I am looking forward to this 3-day weekend.  All I really want to do is hang out inside, watch my cats play and sleep, watch some good movies and maybe do some baking.

New days full of eager audiences waiting in breathless anticipation, the bleachers are always full.  Popcorn and cotton candy in the bellies of happy children.  But the arena is empty and the air is stifled with the thick blanket of indifference.  The soil stained with the blood of old soldiers, ghosts of the soulless regime. Intoxicating viewpoints, seducing entire civilizations.  Fallen Angels laughing at collective religious ignorance.Working, striving, accelerating, trying to keep up.  Thank God for the fire, the warmness and contentment.  Images of light coming to meet me.  A happy reunion, a friend long lost, victims of bad timing.  Lonely travels down the forlorn path Antecedents reminding me of how I could have done it better.  For the only way out is up and the only way up is through the fire.  Redwood trees and granite lead the way though it hardly seems real.  Watching in hiding, listening to the maddening sound of their voices singing through the air, shrill and hollow.  Singing a song about me.  Dancing naked knee deep in my blood.  Ruthless killers couldnt do better this,  though that is of little comfort now. Biting at the heels of contentment, Energy made manifest, seems like matter has betrayed universal law  Im not really sure what that means.  Probably nothing of consequence. Generations lamentations, devastations, spasmodic earth ever changing, rearranging, decks of cards not in order.  Chaotic scrimmages fighting against an invisible enemy steadily marching forward, never looking back.  Steady streams of malcontent effortlessly winding down the forlorn path.  Writhing under the pressure of time, withering bloody corpses of yesterday, today, tomorrow.  Existence as we know it ceases without warning, followed by evolutions, revolutions, new species doomed to repeat our past.  "

It's a co-infection that ticks can carry and is actually similar to Malaria.  I knew in addition to being infected with lyme 13 years ago, that I also got babesiosis.  I had some treatment for it here and there over the years but never enough to truly get rid of it.  We were always so focused on lyme treatment that the Babesia treatment took a back seat.  Mistake!  A lot of people who get lyme disease also get this co-infection and can also get another one called Ehrliciosis (or Ehrlichia).  Fun, huh?  Not.    Anyway - I'm on a new treatment path now, I know my prayers and the prayers of many have given me this answer that I needed so much.  Thank you so much if you've been praying for me!!!  I truly believe it's helping to carve out a clearer path for me.  I've been in such a bad place lately with my health, I was afraid of my coming birthday and just wanted to cancel it.  I didn't want to turn a year older AGAIN, being so sick with no answers...the thought of that was beyond depressing.  Thank goodness for prayer, thank goodness for hope....I actually think I can do a little celebrating today.  33 sounds like a good number for things to finally turn around for me."

In this photo, he is even sharing the couch with my beloved Gumbo.  Grigsby has worked his way into our hearts.  He does have a health issue right now.  Not quite sure what happened, but his upper lip is swollen.  I had noticed a little bit prior to going to the vet.  Once the stress of going to the vet kicked in and he licked and licked and licked, he made that adorable little crack in the middle bleed.  Both lips swelled up even more.  They remain swollen to this day.  I'm watching for evidence of infection, but thankfully none has been found.  No point in putting bacitracin there as that would just encourage him to lick.  I am monitoring closely just hoping it settles down and goes away.  Thankfully, nothing else is swollen on this dear boy.  In fact, he otherwise falls into the category of a perfect cat.  [SOOC]"

I had seen this building on the way down and when I passed it again on the way back, I couldn't resist stopping.   I went on another fun photowalk today downtown and met some new photographers as well as others whom I've shot with before. A lot of the people brought film cameras as did I. I shot a roll with my old Olympus OM-1, something I've been wanting to do since the beginning of this past summer. I also shot some digital and took some self portraits for my 52-week project, but after shooting for a while I discovered that my lens was filthy and it really negatively affected my shots. The difference was amazing after I cleaned it with the aid of a couple of other photographers and stuff they had in their camera bags. I may or may not reshoot tomorrow, still undecided about that. It was a great day and so much fun despite the frigid temperature!  And at the moment, I've got to figure out what's leaking under my kitchen sink, so I'll be catching up on Flickr later.

A variety of philosophical, religious, psychological and biological approaches have striven to define happiness and identify its sources.  Philosophers and religious thinkers often define happiness in terms of living a good life, or flourishing, rather than simply as an emotion. Happiness in this older sense was used to translate the Greek Eudaimonia, and is still used in virtue ethics. In everyday speech today, however, terms such as well-being or quality of life are usually used to signify the classical meaning, and happiness usually refers[citation needed] to the felt experience or experiences that philosophers historically called pleasure."

Also for the sun so I could take all these pictures!  ***Things that happened this year while doing this project.***  1. Truly paid attention to all four seasons and the light they offered.  2. Went from missing a dear friend living in another country to her coming home to me moving away from her.  2. Lived in a house with 3 amazing people and my husband and lived next door to my best friend.  3. Went from hating my job, to getting a job I liked, to being unemployed.  4. Watched one of best friends date my brother-in-law, get engaged, and become my sister-in-law.  5. Battled and brokethrough depression to find true contentment.  6. Picked up and left everything I knew and was comfortable with in Reno and move to a completely new place in Portland.  7. Traveled to The Steens Or, Placerville Ca, San Fransisco Ca, Lake Tahoe Ca, Winnemucca Nv, Portland OR, Ceaderville Ca, Asheville N.C., Isle of Palms S.C..  8. Showed my photography in three art shows.  9. Grew more than I ever thought was possible with my photography.  10. Started School to get my Masters in Counseling.  ***Random Tidbits***  1. Found inspiration from Movies, Books, Music, other art, and other photographers.  2. Wanted to quit about 365 different times but am so happy I didn't only to  have this feeling of accomplishment.  3. Pushed myself and my friends (models) until it hurt just to get that image I wanted.  4. Failed more that I could count on getting what I wanted but was willing to still change my concept to get a image.  5. Spent way to much money on props, makeup, costumes, and blood for images.  6. Took my first real self portrait and then took 186 more.   6. Took my camera everywhere I went and saw art everywhere I looked.   7. Filled two hard drives with all the images taken this last year.   8. I can see I am a different person than I was a year ago, and I like who I have become.   9. Used the phrase ""I am a photo student taking pictures for a project"" to get into some awesome locations, sometimes white lies help...muahaha.  10. Found my joy and excitement for photography again after loosing it to wedding photography.   11. Find it crazy that after using up 365 ideas I still have more in my head I want to create into photographs.   Phew....I hope you made it, thanks for reading this all, truly this project has been an amazing journey for me! "

With the water from that river we can clean our dirty gutters and canals.  A stagnant, putrid pond can be purified by connecting it to the river.  God is like a pure river.

Another pleas-ing note is a softly uttered and oft-re-peated Coo-coo. Mrs. Olive ThorneMiller, who has made a careful study ofthe habits of the Black-billed Cuckoo,describes its alarm note as sounding likethe syllables Cuck-a-ruck. There is no doubt that parasitism ispracticed to some extent by the Black-billed Cuckoo. Its eggs have been foundin the nests of several species of thesmaller birds, such as some of the warb-lers, the catbird, the pewees and therobin. However, such instances are com-paratively rare, while its eggs have beenquite frequently found in the nests of theyellow-billed species.

These animals are so hard to photograph, as they are constantly on the move in their enclosure, LOL.  ""Every time a red panda is born, and particularly every time the cub is raised by its mother, it's an important achievement, because the mortality rate for red panda cubs is as high as 74 per cent.  Since 1994, nine red cub pandas have been born at the Calgary Zoo.  ""It is important to continue to support conservation and protection of red pandas so that some day we see a natural increase in their populations,"" said Tim Sinclair-Smith, curator of the zoo's Eurasia section.  ""There is still a long way to go to this end, but this new birth will have a positive impact on captive population growth and genetic diversity of the species.""  It's estimated there are fewer than 10,000 mature red pandas in the world. They're classified as ""vulnerable"" on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List.""  From CBC News, Calgary.  "

He loves to be around us a lot, so in the morning around seven o'clock he wakes us up by standing up against the sliding door which separates him from us. Then he first welcomes us and collects his share of cuddles before venturing out into the garden.   The situation with Poeka seems to be relaxing now. We decided to give her a private room at night and when we are at work. Ever since we did this, the peeing has stopped (fingers crossed) and she seems to be a lot more relaxed. I also invested quite some extra time and attention in Poeka, which seems to be paying off now. My lap has become a safe haven for her and this often gives me a good excuse to postpone my household chores ......"

I chose these 5 because they elicited the most emotion from me and gave me a certain feeling/ reminded me of a certain memory. I tried to use Depth of Field and unique angles to make otherwise boring objects into interesting subjects.   First off, I would choose the picture of my dog to put up to my right on the spaceship. This photo immediately gives me the feeling of being at home with my family. It reminds me of being warm and safe with those in my life that I love the most. Its a simple photograph, just a snapshot of a typical night at my house, you can even see my dads feet in the background. However this simplicity elicits a feeling of contentment, which I think I would want to feel if I was alone in a spaceship.   The other photo I would want to put up would be the photo of my guitar. This photo reminds me of all the joy Ive received from music, both playing and listening to it. Music is a huge part of my life and some of my best memories are from concerts and music festivals. I would want to remember the feelings I got from listening to music.   The photo of the silhouette of the trees against the sky was taken in Santa Barbara, which is where I went to college. Santa Barbara is one of the most beautiful places Ive ever been to and I wanted to remember my 4 years there and how incredible the sunset is there.    I took a picture of the fruit because I love eating and would want to remember how delicious fruit is. I also loved the different colors of these objects.  Finally, the photograph of the mug of tea gives me a cozy, pleasant feeling looking at it. I feel most comfortable in my bed drinking tea and reading a book.  "

Sassy's niece, her two nephews on the right  and her niece's  main squeeze on the left.  The love and contentment displayed brings tear to my eyes.  Doesn't take much these days to bring tears to my eyes.  Sassy was showing a picture to me yesterday, that her sister had sent her. It was a picture of  Sam, the  young fellow on the right, walking away, at the top of the frame,  to his first day as a freshman in high school, and his dad in the middle of the frame, was standing and watching, as Sam , their youngest, set out to begin his freshman year.  I could have just bawled when I saw that shot.  Mike, Sams dad has a heart condition, and every day  that he is alive is truly a gift to him.  He didn't expect to live this long.  So seeing him standing there, taking in that moment, was just spectacular and soooo emotional for me.   Need some Vicodin or something.  Someone told me I'm blessed ....to have  emotional senses.  Lately  I hate going to church because, God Bless him, our minister has the gift, and his message drives me to tears.  I'm constantly taking off my glasses to wipe my eyes and then  my runny nose. I don't know what taking my glasses off has to do with wiping my runny nose, but wanting to be a good writer makes me look back at that sentence and wonder.     Dang this week went by fast! TGIF!  {Tomorrow}.  It's a three day weekend for us, (me).  Sassy's still looking for a job, but she works her ass off staying at home.     Have a good one!!     "

He has become incorporated into Buddhist, Taoist and Shinto culture and is based on an eccentric Chinese Chn monk who lived in the time of the Liang Dynasty. His image graces many temples, restaurants, and amulets. Budai has become a deity of contentment and abundance, when adopted by Religious Taoists. In Japan, Hotei persists in folklore as one of the Seven Lucky Gods (Shichi Fukujin). He is almost always shown smiling or laughing, hence his nickname in Chinese, the ""Happy Buddha"" -Wikipedia   "

So in a valley remote and fair, Depedale to be sure, he set upon some sandstone cliffs and hacked and hewed with every sinew and muscle taut,  till bit by bit, day by day a place to be a Hermit came about sure enough. And there he said prayers to god, content to shun the world of man, with slivers of light entering the portal of prayers and peace and contentment arose like the maturity of a great oak.  One day, many years passed, A Knight who was lord to the land as far as the eye could see passed this simple dwelling and stunned by simple poverty borne with head held high, gave land and tithe for the Hermits gain, a prize for bearing pain with pleasure in such measure to gain attention from this noble lord. A chapel was built as a  place for prayer. The Hermit;s cave still stands as it once was amidst the ancient mantle of wildwood green."
