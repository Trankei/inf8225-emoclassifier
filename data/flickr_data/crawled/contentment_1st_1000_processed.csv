contentment,http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7162/6541638261_72265e9439_z.jpg,1,4,"simple kindness My religion is very simple. My religion is kindness.   This is my simple religion. There is no need for temples; no need for complicated philosophy. Our own brain, our own heart is our temple; the philosophy is kindness.   We can live without religion and meditation, but we cannot survive without human affection.  I believe that the very purpose of life is to be happy. From the very core of our being, we desire contentment. In my own limited experience I have found that the more we care for the happiness of others, the greater is our own sense of well-being. Cultivating a close, warmhearted feeling for others automatically puts the mind at ease. It helps remove whatever fears or insecurities we may have and gives us the strength to cope with any obstacles we encounter. It is the principal source of success in life. Since we are not solely material creatures, it is a mistake to place all our hopes for happiness on external development alone. The key is to develop inner peace.  ~Dalai Lama  Struggling to understand life.  Reaching out for answers, I came across these beautiful quotes.  Seems the older I get, the more questions I have and the less I know.  When I was 17 I had it all figured out.  Now I find myself asking questions I haven't asked or even thought about since I was a kid.  I rejected organized religion longer ago than I can remember.  I've been a very open, vocal, and proud atheist since high school.  We weren't put here for a reason.  Life has no meaning.  Shit happens and I was perfectly okay with that.  Now all the shit that happens is really getting to me.  I find myself needing an explanation for why these awful things happen.  I still don't believe there is an answer.  Random, senseless, tragic things happen and there never will be an explanation.  But this simple philosophy of kindness moves me.  It is a way out of the darkness and despair.  The sense of fulfillment that comes from giving something of yourself to another is beyond compare.  Giving with no expectation of anything in return.  Kindness is the reward.  It builds upon itself.  Cruelty is a force for destruction.  It tears us all down.  Kindness builds us all up.  I only want to be a force for good.  There is no looking back.  "

I was just looking for Albert Einstein quotes and came across this one. It made me smile and then I thought about it. And what he was saying is to focus on the present. Learning to be fully present, where you are giving your 100% attention to whatever youre currently doing, is the key to success and fulfillment in life.   --------------------------------------------  I hadn't see the professor since early spring when I first photographed him in Wicker Park. He was infinitely patient last Saturday while I played around with my camera and flash settings. He didn't even pause at all from conversation as he snapped my picture with his cell phone.

Fields  Proving that the culinary artistry of Christopher M. can satisfy the most discriminating taste, the artists latest image titled Savor the Moment was selected as the official poster image for the Las Vegas Art Expo 2008. As Christopher pursues his celebration of the culinary arts, Savor the Moment captures a refreshing pause after a job well done. The chef is consumed by the exquisite bouquet of a glass of perfectly balanced, fine wine. It is obvious that his discerning palate has been satisfied by his look of quiet contentment.  Christophers masterful use of color sets the tone. The monochromatic background of icy blues seamlessly blends into the foreground where his figure is illuminated by the brilliant white of the chefs traditional attire. This dynamic contrast pulls the portrait into focus and completes his poignant, artistic statement.  This work also serves as a reminder of one very important rule of thumb for master (and perhaps not-so-masterful) chefs around the world: Dont cook with any wine you wouldnt drink. Congratulations to Christopher and compliments to the chef. Cheers!  www.ecgallery.com"

Because of this, off-leash is not really a problem.  On this President's day holiday, the weather in Florida was absolutely spectacular.  I was striving for that ""perfect beach portrait"", but Lexy had too much fun and had seagulls on her mind.  She didn't really want to sit still because of all of the great smells birds she was chasing.   She cooperated only for a few moments.  I got some spectacular expressions.   Yes, we know that those of you up north are braving the cold and snow and our hearts go out to you all.  We hope you are all safe and warm."

But some occasions just call for tea.   In England, there's a thing about milky tea; a magical, slightly disgusting sounding drink whose remedial properties are second-to-none. It can, among other things, take the sting out of harsh words; warm one's wind-chapped fingers; ease the transition from early-morning bleariness to mid-morning semi-alertness; can be flavoured with liquor for extra fun; is the perfect hot bevvy to offer a friend, or just as equally, can be enjoyed on one's own with a biscuit for dunking. But what I love best about tea is that feeling of utter contentment that comes with the second mouthful.   Maybe, if all the world's leaders and all the world's men and women sat down at the same time with a cuppa, the world could be a happier place. It really is quite amazing stuff.

Petals on the tiny flowers Seem more delicate. And the breezes rise and fall, Telling the days fate. The wind is whispering.  As you whirl to natures song, You start to feel so free, You forget all but the sound Of the wind and trees.  When youre dizzy and Breathless with relief, Have a seat in a field. Forget any grief.   You will find more peace in life And maybe contentment When you realize your drama is Not quite so important.  A day with the wind is a day with life. It sends you peace and warnings. Listen to the wind, my friend; Youll never find it boring.  When life just bogs you down And troubles at no end, There Is a way to peace again: Just listen to the wind. ~~  "

The weather here and around the country was unseasonably warm and set records for high temperature of the day. I should have called in sick. At any rate, I headed out for a late lunch today to take my shot for the day. I could have sat here and basked in the warmth of the sun until it went down.  First of all let me say, when I headed out, it was not with the intention of acting like a fool in public. I drove along and saw this red stripe on the side of the Target building and thought it would be perfect for the ODC leading lines and would go great with my red coat.  I parked my car along the side of the building so that my wouldn't appear in my shot, however it wasn't a parking spot. I set up my tripod. Well...my jerry-rigged tripod where I have a clamp clipped to the screw on the top, then rubber band my iPhone to the clamp.  I was setup towards the back of the building on the side and behind the camera is a walking/biking path along the forest preserve. As I was taking shots, trying to get everything framed right, a couple of bikers went by and watched me as they slowed way down. Then two runners came by and decided to stop to stretch.  I shrugged that off and continued on.   While I was squatting down behind my iPhone/tripod reviewing the last shot, around the corner came a Target employee and a cop. Ruh-roh! They wanted to know what I was doing. Um....well....um.....I'm doing this self-portrait project.....and I.....um....thought your red strip looked pretty cool. They both looked at me like they just didn't know what to say, then finally said, well you can't park your car there. I told them I'd be done and move it in a minute. They both moved on and continued around the building.   For We're Here! Acting Like a Fool in Public - Join 'We're Here!' for inspiration and illumination of your 365 project!

The monkey also goes by the Malay name monyet belanda (Dutch monkey), or even orang belanda (Dutchman), as Indonesians remarked that the Dutch colonisers often had similarly large bellies and noses.  This species of monkey is easily identifiable because of its unusually large nose.  Photo: Copyright notice  All rights reserved. "

Those who know that I am not a dog person will wonder why I like this photo. I guess it's because I have had cats and I can relate to this scene...they are so adoreable!

Let me just say that he was a doll to work with and you really should check out his photostream!  His challenge to me was: ""So after lots of thinking I would like you to build on this for the push. I would like to see you really thinking in terms trying to convey a mood or feeling through your photos. This could be could be with a portrait (expressions, composition and framing, light,contrast), an abstract or a landscape (mist, light, colour, texture and lines). I will leave it with you to decide this subject and style, but try and choose a subject that has a big impact on you and makes you ""feel"" strongly and try and convey this feeling and mood through your photography.  I hope all makes sense Amanda - it is probably not a easy challange - but for me being able think in terms of conveying a feeling and mood and showing this in your work is the holy grail for a photographer.""  This was perfect timing for me as I recently let the world know that my husband and I are expecting our first baby! So... I instantly thought of all the feelings and emotions that play into that-- the all day nausea and fatigue, the contentment of eating something I've been craving, the excitement of it all! My goal was to actually try out something of each of these ideas. But, sadly, the fatigue has hit pretty hard and I ended up going with the only thing I tried out-- your typical growing belly shot.   This isn't exactly what I was hoping to do, but I played around with GIMP a bit to try to add to an emotional feel.   I know this isn't exactly the Holy Grail, Phil. I will definitely try again later to get what I might have had in mind!   Oh and in case you're wondering, I'm 9 weeks =o) "
