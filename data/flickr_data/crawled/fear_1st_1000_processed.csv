A series of five posts (see adjacent images in my photostream) dedicated to the magnificent lynx spiders of the family Oxyopidae of Pu'er, Yunnan, China.  Lynx spiders are the members of the family Oxyopidae. They all are hunting spiders that spend their lives on plants, flowers and shrubs. They approach their prey slowly then pounce, hence the common name Lynx spiders.  Oxyopidae in general rely on keen eyesight in stalking, chasing, or ambushing prey, and also in avoiding enemies. Six of their eight eyes are arranged in a hexagon-like pattern, a characteristic that identifies them as members of the family Oxyopidae. The other two eyes are smaller and generally situated in front and below the other six. The Oxyopidae also have spiny legs, and in many species those legs, augmented by the spines, seem to be used as a sort of catching-basket in trapping flying insects.  This is a family of spider which is well represented locally in Yunnan with a fair degree of diversity. I have knowingly observed four genera - Oxyopes, Peucetia, Hamadruas and Hamataliwa. Identification to species is a little more challenging due to a scarcity of reference material.  They are very conducive to being photographed as they tend to posture defiantly in the open seemingly without fear in many cases. If they do take fright, they are capable of moving at lightning speeds, usually to the opposite side of the leaf they are on. However, a gentle wave of the hand in their general direction will return them to the original position. Usually they are reluctant to depart from their favorite haunts but will fling themselves into space if they feel particularly threatened.  Pu'er, Yunnan, China    You can see all of my lynx images on Flickr  HERE.                              "

With the discovery of gold, the pleasant pastoral scene changed as the gold seekers from various parts of the world invaded the country-side looking for the precious metal. The first unofficial record of a discovery of gold in the area was at Daisy Hill on Hall and McNeills Glen Mona Run. The discovery was made by a shepherd, Thomas Chapman. This discovery was not reported for fear of prosecution for gold digging. Official gold finds in Victoria date from 1851, but there is evidence of many unofficial finds like the one at Glen Mona. The first official discovery in the area around Talbot was made by two South Australians and their families at Daisy Hill Creek (later Amherst) in 1852. One of the men was Cowley, the other was John Potter. Potter claimed they unearthed a nugget while trying to free a bogged wagon. The rush to Daisy Hill followed his discovery. Amherst was first called by that name in official letters in May 1853. The population in those early years drifted up and down according to the reports from other areas. The miners started to test the ground around Back Creek and soon discoveries were made. During 1854 the only mining at Back Creek was on the creek about 2 and half miles from Amherst. Later in 1854 there was a big rush to Amherst and Back Creek. The rich ground of Ballarat Hill, Nuggetty Gully and Kangaroo Flat (Carallulup) were opened up. At the beginning of 1855 there were about 2500 diggers and store owners at Back Creek as well as 300 women and children. There was a certain amount of crime on the gold fields. Horse stealing, burglaries and violence were common."

On this snowy evening, I went out looking for good night shots in response to the push from my partner for  Get Pushed - Round 16 ,  Anna, aka string-of-lights.    She asked for a night shot, with no restrictions, and I thought I would push myself more specifically into the light of street lights, since I normally prefer to use natural light wherever possible.  My ""comfort zone"" for night shots is characterized by long exposures by moonlight or late dusk.  Going for street light, I assumed I would end up with a noir-ish shot that would do well in Black and White.    So, noir-ish, yes, but no B&W for this shot.  The power drains right out of it  along with the color.  I never guessed I'd get an assist at light painting from the coincidental colors of different street lights!  When I was there, the red color of the door caught my eye and led me to take this picture.  I didn't register the deathly pallor of the light in the cemetery until I saw it on the computer at home.  In the Episcopal Church, we often paint church doors red to remind us of how the Israelites were protected from death during the Passover.  So here we have a little allegory for the passage from the fears and dangers of mortal life into eternal life.    A couple of B&W outtakes are in the comments.  I like them a lot, but I didn't have to push myself to get them.  By the way, Anna has a very imaginative and instrospective photostream.  Check it out!"

Was I still vulnerable on the inside of that wall?    Yes.  But I had isolated myself from life and love.  And most people only knew a shadow of who I truly am on the inside.  Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure, or nothing. -- Helen Keller   for Self Portrait Challenge - Walls"
