A unique award-winning living museum that offers an excellent fascinating glimpse of rural Sarawak life as it was, before the old skills and older ways of life were lost to modernity. Located at the foot of the legendary Mount Santubong, the Sarawak Cultural Village portrays the cultures and traditional lifestyles of the seven major ethnic groups of Sarawak.  The Melanau or Malano tribe live on the island of Borneo, primarily in Sarawak, Malaysia, but also in Kalimantan, Indonesia. According to the ancient document, Kagarakretagama of the Hindu kingdom of Majapahit, both Barune and Malano were their tributaries. After the fall of the Majapahit empire, Malano and many other adjacent territories were conquered by Brunei. Melanau was the name given by one of the Sultans of Brunei to the inhabitants of the coastal swamp flats and riverbanks of central Sarawak. Initially they called themselves A-likou or Liko, meaning 'people of the river'. There are many distinct sub-groups but now diluted with continuous inter-marriage with other races and tribes. The Melanau cultures and dialects is gradually  disappearing due to modernization.  The Melanau used to live close to sea and as a result were exposed to many pirate attacks, hence they built sturdy houses, called lamin dana (literally meaning 'traditional house' in Melanau) some 15 m above ground. Sago is the staple diet of these people, unlike other natives who lived on rice.   ""A space in the lamin dana where artifacts and elements once used in the shamanic healing rituals, called bebayuh are displayed. The faith healers or spirit mediums were said to be respected and feared figures in the community who combined handicraft and magic, and assisted by the familiar spirits in the healing rituals. The peculiarity of each sickness is diagnosed by the healer and subsequently the exact spirit image or tew causing a particular sickness is carved onto a piece of softwood or sago pith effigy (sickness image) called bilum.  A short ceremony, forces the tew into its carved image and is then placed in a model boat, provisioned for a long voyage, and sent off down river. Chants and ceremonies accompanied this launching. There were many more bizarre rituals once adopted by the tribe, such as farewell rite to the deceased to the land of the dead (likou dayah or likou a-mataicalled) called pisak lukan or timang bubu (fish-trap dance). The life size fish trap is said to gyrate and bob around the room as if being pulled by invisible strings until it disintegrates. Another communal ritual is the annual cleansing ceremony called kaul, to call uninvited spirits that have taken up residence in the village to a feast before they are sent home to their proper places. Today, kaul is relegated as a tradition where families return for the year's reunion.""  This is a soul-catching wooden mask used in shamanic rituals, I presume.

This is the grave, In Alton, Hampshire, of the tragic 8 year old that the term ""Sweet FA"" comes from. In short She was gruesomely murdered on 24 August 1867 ""In 1869 new rations of tinned mutton were introduced for British seamen. They were unimpressed by it, and decided it must be the butchered remains of Fanny Adams. The way her body had been strewn over a wide area presumably encouraged speculation that parts of her had been found at the Royal Navy victualling yard in Deptford, which was a large facility which included stores, a bakery and an abattoir."" ""Fanny Adams"" became slang for mutton or stew and then for anything worthless  from which comes the current use of ""sweet Fanny Adams"" (or just ""sweet F.A."") to mean ""nothing at all"". It can be seen as a euphemism for ""f*ck all""  which means the same.""  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanny_Adams  The inscription reads: ""Sacred to the memory of Fanny Adams aged 8 years and 4 months who was cruelly murdered on Saturday August 24th 1867.

They have been produced to raise awareness of the issue in the run up to Christmas.  The images have been taken by the Forces photographers.  Detective Chief Superintendent Vanessa Jardine from GMPs Public Protection Division, said: Domestic abuse is our number one priority and the safety of victims is paramount. We know from our own information that one in four women will be a victim in their lifetime as will one in six men. This is sad statistic which highlights the scale of the problem across Greater Manchester particularly during the festive period, when finances become tighter and tensions get higher.   Our campaign aims to encourage victims and friends and family of victims to come forward and be aware of the support services that can help those men and women suffering from abuse. Victims should not feel like they have to suffer in silence as all reports made to us are taken seriously and how difficult domestic abuse incidents can be.   Figures show that between Christmas Eve and New Years Day last year there were 2,096 reports made to police about domestic abuse. This compares to 1,444 the previous. The shocking statistics show a 45 per cent increase highlights that the fight against domestic abuse is not over and that more work needs to be done.   The Domestic Abuse Helpline is also available to offer support for victims on 0808 2000 247.   To access Victim Supports services you can call, text, email or self-refer.

(2013)  www.amctv.com/shows/immortalized  =========================================== The Sea Rabbit (Monafluffchus americanus) of Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York  This unique sea-dwelling rabbit, which is actually a close relative of the sea lion, was officially discovered and investigated by Henry Hudson when he first visited this land to colonize the area by order of the Dutch government. It was named New Amsterdam -- todays New York City. This island was named after he saw the beach covered with strange swimming wild rabbits. The word Coney Island means wild rabbit island in Dutch (originally Conyne Eylandt, or Konijneneiland in modern Dutch spelling). Sea rabbits were also referred mermaid rabbit, merrabbit, rabbit fish or seal rabbit in the natural history documents in the 17th century. The current conservation status, or risk of extinction, of the sea rabbit is Extinct in the Wild.   This website features two species of sea rabbits, which have been taken care of by Dr. Takeshi Yamada () at the Coney Island Sea Rabbit Repopulation Center, which is a part of the Marine biology department of the Coney Island University in Brooklyn, New York. They are  Coney Island Sea Rabbit (Monafluffchus americanus) called Seara and Coney Island Tiger-striped Sea Rabbit (Monafluffchus konjinicus) called Stripes.   The photographs and videos featured in this website chronicle adventures of the Coney Island sea rabbits and the world as seen by them. This article also documented efforts of Dr. Takeshi Yamada for bringing back the nearly extinct sea rabbits to Coney Island in the City of New York and beyond. Dr. Yamada produced a series of public lectures, workshops, original public live interactive fine art performances and fine art exhibitions about sea rabbits at a variety of occasions and institutions in the City of New York and beyond. Dr. Yamada is an internationally active educator, book author, wildlife conservationist and high profile artist, who lives and works in Brooklyn, New York.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sea Rabbit  Other Common Names: Coney Island Sea Rabbit, Beach Rabbit, Seal Rabbit, mer-rabbit, merrabbit, Atlantic Sea Rabbit.  Latin Name: Monafluffchus americanus  Origin: Atlantic coast of the United States  Description of the specimen: In the early 17th centurys European fur craze drove the fleet of Dutch ships to the eastern costal area of America. Then Holland was the center of the world just like the Italy was in the previous century. New York City was once called New Amsterdam when Dutch merchants landed and established colonies. Among them, Henry Hudson is probably the most recognized individual in the history of New York City today. This small island is inhabited by two major creatures which we do not have in our homeland. The one creature is a large arthropod made of three body segments: the frontal segment resembles a horseshoe, the middle segment resembles a spiny crab and its tail resembles a sharp sword. Although they gather beaches here in great numbers, they are not edible due to their extremely offensive odor. Another creature which is abundant here, has the head of wild rabbit. This animal of great swimming ability has frontal legs resemble the webbed feet of a duck. The bottom half of the body resembles that of a seal. This docile rabbit of the sea is easy to catch as it does not fear people. The larger male sea rabbits control harems of 20 to 25 females. The meat of the sea rabbit is very tender and tasty. This is what Hadson wrote in his personal journal in 1609 about the horseshoe crab and the sea rabbit in todays Coney Island area of Brooklyn, New York. Sadly, just like the Dodo bird and the Thylacine, the sea rabbit was driven to extinction by the European settlers greed. When Dutch merchants and traders arrived here, sea rabbits were one of the first animals they hunted down to bring their furs to homeland to satisfy the fur craze of the time. To increase the shipment volume of furs of sea rabbit and beavers from New Amsterdam, Dutch merchants also started using wampum (beads made of special clam shells) as the first official currency of this country.   At the North Eastern shores of the United States, two species of sea rabbits were commonly found. They are Coney Island Sea Rabbit (Monafluffchus americanus) and Coney Island Tiger-striped Sea Rabbit (Monafluffchus konjinicus). Sadly, due to their over harvesting in the previous centuries, their conservation status became Extinct in the Wild (ET) in the Red List Endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Currently, these sea rabbits are only found at breeding centers at selected zoos and universities such as Coney Island Aquarium and Coney Island University in Brooklyn, New York. The one shown in this photograph was named ""Seara"" and has been cared by Dr. Takeshi Yamada at Coney Island University.   The sea rabbit is one of the families of the Pinniped order. Pinnipeds (from Latin penna = flat and pes/pedis = foot) are sea-mammals: they are homeothermic (i.e having high and regulated inner temperature), lung-breathing (i.e dependant on atmospheric oxygen) animals having come back to semi aquatic life. As soon as they arrive ashore, females are caught by the nearest adult male. Males can maintain harems of about 20 females on average. Several hours to several days after arriving ashore, pregnant females give birth to eight to ten pups with a dark brown fur. As soon as birth occurs, the mothers special smell and calls help her pups bond specifically to her. The mother stays ashore with her pup for about one week during which the pup gains weight. During the first week spent with her newborn, the mother becomes receptive. She will be impregnated by the bull, which control the harem. Implantation of the embryo will occur 3 months later, in March-April. During the reproductive period, the best males copulate with several tens females. To do so, males have to stay ashore without feeding in order to keep their territory and their harem. In mid-January, when the last females have been fecundated, males leave at sea to feed. Some of them will come back later in March-April for the moult. The other ones will stay at sea and will come back on Coney Island only in next November. After fecundation, the mother goes at sea for her first meal. At sea, mothers feed on clams, crabs, shrimps, fish (herring, anchovy, Pollock, capelin etc.) and squids. When she is back, the mother recovers her pups at the beach she left them. Suckling occurs after auditive and olfactory recognition had occured. In March-April, the dark brown fur is totally replaced by an adult-like light brownish grey fur during the moult that lasts 1-2 months. This new fur is composed by 2 layers. Externally, the guard fur is composed by flat hairs that recover themselves when wet. By doing so, they make a water-proof barrier for the under fur. The underfur retains air when the seal is dry. Because of isolating properties of the air, the underfur is the insulating system of the fur. In March-April, the fur of adults is partially replaced. First reproduction occurs at 1-yr old in females. Males are physiologically matures at 1 year old but socially matures at +2 years old.    NOTE: The name of Coney Island is commonly thought to be derived from the Dutch Konijn Eylandt or Rabbit Island as apparently the 17th century European settlers noted many rabbits running amuck on the island.   =========================================== Reference: Dr. Takeshi Yamada was an Immortalizer on Immortalized, the AMC cable televisions new original unscripted television series about competitive taxidermy.

In depth of screams, there are hard as nails introspection, full of pain and fear which is much stronger than all the darkness of scream.

Surely if anyone can fix the economy, it is the man who has hired every private sector sysadmin genius and managed to expand the 500 million lines of code website to accomodate a few more thousand simultaneous requests.... before it crashes again.  From Reuters:   Jeffrey Zients, charged with fixing the troubled HealthCare.gov website, will be replaced when he leaves to start his new job as a top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, a White House official said on Monday.     Jennifer Palmieri, the White House communications director, told MSNBC that Zients' departure date as a special adviser for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is as yet unclear.     Zients was chosen by Obama in September to take over from Gene Sperling as director of the White House National Economic Council. That job is supposed to start on January 1.     ""Right now Jeff is focused on the website,"" Palmieri said. ""He's going to continue that for the immediate future. He will become the NEC director at some point, I'm not sure exactly the date.     ""But the other thing that we want people to understand is that when Jeff does leave, that it was always going to be a short-term assignment for him, that he will be replaced by someone,"" Palmieri said. -==================================================================== SS.......................TESTING...............TESTING   'If you think health care is expensive now, wait until you see what it costs when it's free.'         -  P.J. O'Rourke  If CNN was doing its best this morning to prove that the second coming of healthcare.gov is fixed, it... failed.   Transcript:   GEORGE HOWELL, HOST: We know the first thing you have to do when you go to this website you have to select your state. Is that working?     ALISON KOSIK, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: And what's funny is I was talking with Matt, and, yeah, that seemed to work, right, when you logged on. But then came the road blocks. So tell me about what happened, because we're getting another error message here, and it's supposed to be running smoothly. Were just not seeing that.     MATT SLOANE, CNN MEDICAL PRODUCER: Yeah, so, you know, we've been trying to get into the site since October 1 on and off again. I have to say it did work a lot more smoothly this morning. I got through. I picked my state. I put in all of my information and I got through the whole process in eight minutes. And then it said my status was in progress. So I went to refresh it and I got the error message.  But fear not. According to David Plouffe, 2008 campaign manager for Barack Obama, Obamacare ""will work reall well""... by 2017. To wit:   This program was designed to be implemented by the states. And in most of the states it is going quite well. You talked about Medicaid expansion. I think it's just a fact, and it may take until 2017 when this president leaves office, you're going to see almost every state in this country running their own exchanges eventually and expanding Medicaid. And I think it'll work really well, then. ====================================================================== SS....2017 huh...........PROVING YET AGAIN .................""YOU CAN'T FIX STUPID"""

I imagined this spectacular closing ceremony of the Nuclear Security Summit, with a meaningful display of relevant data in the middle and a triptych with three global significant video works to further better understanding. (the openings ceremony was an  ultra bad taste pop-festival like show with some light-show effects and a 'smiering' female violin-player, dancers and singers, expressing a record level of euphemism.

(2) NUCLEAR STATES & THEIR SHARING PARTNERS (NB I did adapt the colours on the world map, as the original has dark blue for non-nuclear stats, which makes the reading of the map difficult, one should dim or leave out that what is not concerned in info-graphics of this kind. tj.): ""Nuclear sharing is a concept in NATO's policy of nuclear deterrence, which involves member countries without nuclear weapons of their own in the planning for the use of nuclear weapons by NATO, and in particular provides for the armed forces of these countries to be involved in delivering these weapons in the event of their use. As part of nuclear sharing, the participating countries carry out consultations and take common decisions on nuclear weapons policy, maintain technical equipment required for the use of nuclear weapons (including warplanes capable of delivering them), and store nuclear weapons on their territory. In case of war, the United States told NATO allies the NPT would no longer be controlling."" en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_sharing  (3) NUCLEAR DETONATIONS TIMELINE 1945-1998.. this is masterly visualised by the Japanese artist Isao Hashimoto, who has plotted all these explosions that took place from 1945 up to 1998 in a time-lapse video map. www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnqRQg-W0k  - This video dates from the year 2003, and does have certain limitations, nevertheless it is one of the few 'dramatisations' of data on nuclear tests that aims at a non-specialist audience. There are many repetituous web references, this one gives at least some context of the workk: ""Hashimoto is a curator at the Lalique Museum in Hakone, Japan. The video was created in 2003 as a series expressing Hashimoto's view of, ""the fear and the folly of nuclear weapons."" The video represents nuclear tests with a colored dot and a beep on a map. It starts slow in 1945, showing a world view of a couple flashes in the southwestern United States before zooming in on the two bombs dropped in Japan. The video then pans out and continues for the duration from a birds-eye view of the world. The climax comes between 1955 and 1970 as the Soviet Union joined the U.S. as a nuclear power and England, France, India and Pakistan eventually joined the arms race."" readwrite.com/2012/02/10/video_artists_time-lapse_map_of_...

I returned to the site of this cottage after previously photographing it some years ago. I was delighted to see it was still derelict, as though I am very concerned about the plight of the homeless and lack of housing for the present and future generation, there is so much beauty in a derelict building, especially a rural one. It reminds me of my childhood, where I played in old farmhouses, cottages, barns, and shepherd huts that have tragically long since vanished, along with the local country folk and communities to be lost forever. They have been often replaced by professional people who have no time for their neighbours and tear down the remnants of their rural buildings and properties, to `modernise` and `IMPROVE` them to add value for when they leave and move on with a profit. Yes, you can`t hold back time and change will always happen but I fear we have lost so much, and not just dialect and customs. So for me, to still see these ramshackle old farms with a yard full of nettles and old implements, and milk churns, I  raise a glass (or camera !) to the past that`s gone...but which will never be forgotten in my mind and heart !!!."

That's my Gradmother saying goodbye to her ""honey"", as she called him. She was married to my Grandfather for 68 years. They were the most amazing couple. The closest thing I have EVER seen to true love. My Grandfather died last Saturday of cancer. My Grandmother was right by his side, telling him she loved him, though she doesn't remember any of it. My Grandmother has dementia. I can't even put into words how hearbreaking it is, to have to see your Grandmother, relive the news of the love of her lifes death over and over again because she forgets. The day of his death, she asked almost every 4 minutes where her ""honey"" was. Almost a week later she learns about his death on a average of, I would say, 50 times a day...if not more. To have to tell her he's gone, and see her break down that often, is absolutely devastating to watch.  I hope and pray one day soon they find a cure for dementia and alzheimers.  Part of the reason I take photos is to remember. I have a pretty bad memory myself ( and with alzheimer's on both sides of my family, memory loss is a huge fear for me) but I can remember EVERY single photo I have ever taken. I can remember the way I felt as I took it, the smells around me, the sounds, the people who were with me...it's pretty amazing to me. Though this is one photo I'd rather not remember."

Headbangers Ball was on Sundays. Complete freedom for the preteen, at least at night. My babysitter would wake me up at 7am to curl my bangs and put on nail polish.   A middle school party house, every Thursday night. Celebrity-bowler-power-couple-parents routinely arrive home no earlier than 4 am. We smoked pot from detached spigots  haphazardly sealed with electrical tape and covered with the grease of a hundred teenage fingers.   I knew being gay was fatal. Muted sexuality and carefully choreographed mannerisms. I rehearse the terrible scenario of being found out. I disappoint the poltergeist who struck fear in me for so many years. The shaking bed and demon growl provoke a dim response. Oblivion is both an ecstatic catharsis and a grim specter.   I go with my gut feeling about colors, lines, subject matter, etc. I like risk, reward and chance. Thats probably why I have a gambling problem. But seriously  it should be noted that Im not just blindly throwing darts and hoping to hit a bulls-eye. Notes are taken. Successes are highlighted, failures are underlined.   Catharsis is a psychology term for the crisis or climax of emotion that occurs before healing.  "

This one got delayed mainly because I have a big fear of dropping camera in the water :P Just couldn't imagine putting it on tripod anywhere close to a waterbody and then stepping away even for a split second. Anyway, Hubby offered to help and there finally I had a chance to try this out.  Not exactly what I had imagined, but this has been a big learning experience. Hope to do more underwater kind of images ;)   Cheers!  --------------------------  More ...  ::   Facebook page  :: Twitter  :: 500 :: Blog ::   :: Food Photography  & Portfolio ::  "

But what happens when problems in your real life become absorbed into your subconscious and disturb your flights of the imagination?  Over the years Ive developed a profound interest in Sigmund Freud, an influential psychologist of the early 20th century.  A lot of Freuds work dealt with dream interpretations and how problems within our daily life affect the meanings of our dreams.  Through my concentration Im exploring the idea that our external conflicts do appear in our dreams and Im using myself as the subject.     Throughout my series I explored my dreams in a soft palette of black and white and color. I decided to do this in order to create a separation of the dream world and reality. While in the dream world, Images 1  9, I shot my photographs in black and white.  In my final three pictures (Images 10  12), there is a transformation into color with a gradual increase in brightness and saturation as Im waking up from my dream. My reasoning for this was also for the viewer to gain a sense of realization. Although my series has both black and white and color, each photograph is shot in high contrast studio lighting.  Images 5  9 are representative of the death of innocence, not an actual suicide.  This was to create an intense urgency throughout the dream world but to make the viewer question whether it was actually me dying or a certain part of me. While I used high contrast, I also used my light sources to emphasize things I wanted the viewers to see. I wanted to emphasize things like: the models (in Images 1  4) that played the role of representing sexuality, fears, thinking with your heart or with your head as shadows, hands, bodies.  I also incorporated reoccurring objects (such as the rope and the sheets) throughout my series to weave a sense of mystery throughout the series. "
