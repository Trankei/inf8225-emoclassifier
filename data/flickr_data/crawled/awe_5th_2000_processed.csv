Lindt is proud to join THE BIG EGG HUNT 2013 in support for Action For Children  Our fun family event starts in London, Covent Garden on Shrove Tuesday and promises to delight all; from the exciting egg-hunts and giant chocolate bunnies to the uniquely designed eggs by leading artists and celebrities, for all to awe at  and hopefully buy!  Most importantly it is a unique opportunity for us all to raise significant money to support vulnerable and neglected children in the UK.  Established in 1869, Action for Children is committed to helping the most vulnerable and neglected children in the UK. Working directly with more than 250,000 children, young people and their carers each year, we run over 600 services which tackle abuse, neglect, help young carers and provide fostering and adoption services.  Lindt believes in the magic of families, which is why the Lindt Gold Bunny is proud to join Action for Children in The Big Egg Hunt and support the great work they do to improve the lives of children & families in the UK."

To our left are the ruins of the Temple of Domitian. A tourist appears to be awe struck at the scale of the temple. Located to the south end of the Domitian Street, it is the first structure in Ephesus known to be dedicated to an emperor. It was built on a high and wide terrace set by 50x100 meters in size, on vaulted foundations. The northern size of the terrace seems to be two-stories high, reached by stairs. The stairs are still visible today.  (Ephesus (Efes)/ Selcuk, Kusadasi, Turkey, Nov. 2014)                              "

Some of these renowned sights are the Arena, sixth largest in the world or Twin Gates, the Temple of Augustus, the well-preserved Roman Forum or the Communal Palace. However, not as much information is known about the impressive heritage of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy dating from the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, undoubtedly a real cultural and historic treasure. In fact, this refers to entire Pula, which from 1820 to 1916 was being architecturally shaped as a fortified town. Once the major naval port of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy Pula, together with its surroundings, has kept for over a century 26 magnificent forts or fortifications, as well as 8 artillery batteries, about 60 batteries, trenches, underground tunnels and many other points of interest. The outer ring of Pula's fortifications covers an area of 40,000 hectares and according to legend all forts were interconnected by a network of underground tunnels. Especially interesting is the story according to which Fort Marie Louise at Muzil was connected with the fort on the Brijuni islands by an underwater tunnel.  Pula's fortifications were designed to defend the city from possible attacks from the sea and were built to resist every possible attack - for this reason they were mostly circular or ring-like so that shells could rebound off the walls. They were all built at excellent locations, mostly lookouts that even today offer a magnificent view.  The fortifications of Pula and its surroundings were never used for a specific attack and defense of the city, although according to some sources, in 1915 Pula's garrison consisted of as many as 1,410 officers and over 51 thousand soldiers. Owing to the fact that the forts were never attacked from the sea, today Pula has a completely preserved significant fortification complex. "

It always gets a large crowd, last year we had 55 people, this year, 62. And winters are the perfect time to visit this massive site. There is large area to be explored, and walking here is almost a mini trek, with its rocky terrain & ruins almost consumed by vegetation. Add to it the reputation of its builders, the dynasty of the Tughluqs & the notorious tiff between the rulers & Nizamuddin Auliya, the revered Chishti sufi saint, which led to the site & the dynasty being cursed. The site has a sense of mystery that inspires awe among all its explorers & the legends magnify the sense of wonder. Perhaps this is what makes Tughluqabad one of the most interesting sites in Delhi.  Our heritage walks starts at the entrance to the fort, near the ticket counter. The fort itself is divided into three areas: the citadel, the palace area & the city. This heritage trail covers the first two & then the tomb of Ghiyasuddin Tughluq which stands across the road from the fort. It takes at least half a day to cover these three. And there remains much more to be explored such as the dam on Mehrauli Badarpur Road, Adilabad Fort, Nai Ka Kot. Much of the city has been taken over by a modern village which infact grows every day. So, many of the ruins which were visible 10 years ago, do not survive anymore. Recently there was an ASI directive asking the residents to vacate as the former claimed ownership of land. The residents in turn argued that they have been staying here for generations. The matter is in court.  As we walk through the palace area we explore the fortification walls, a baoli, a gateway now called the Hathi Gate, granaries, farm lands, & official court buildings which included multiple courtyards with gateways & a ceremonial ground. The palace area also includes the East gate to the city & what are believed to be stables. The citadel has evidence of palace buildings of private nature, including remains of a late Mughal settlement. There are underground rooms, a baoli, a small mosque, a secret escape route & the Jahan numa or the Vijay Mandal. The last is the highest point here & offers a great view of the entire city, the massive fortifications, the tomb of Ghiyasuddin Tughluq, the Mehrauli Badarpur Road which was created by breaching the causeway, the site of the lake which surrounded the tomb & the Adilabad fort. Thats when one senses the magnificence of these ruins frozen in time.  (posted by Kanika Singh & Kavita Singh, team members, Delhi Heritage Walks) "

Dedicated to the maiden goddess Athena, Whom the people of Athens considered their patron began its construction in 447 BC and even though construction was completed by 438 BC decoration continued until 432 BC. The Parthenon is considered the most important surviving building of classical Greece and replaced an older temple of Athena that was destroyed in the Persian invasion of 480 BC. The temple during its history was used as a treasury and later during the 5th century was converted to a church and then to a mosque in the early 1460s. On September 1687 whilst being used as an ammunition dump it was ignited by Venetian bombardment severely damaging the Parthenon."

Press the ""L"" key, or click on the images to enlarge (then press the ""exc"" key to return).  These are un-cropped images. I was using the Canon 5D Mark II with a Canon 15mm f/2.8 fisheye lens, and I believe Enrique was using a Nikon D3 with the Nikkor 16mm f/2.8D Fisheye. My horizon looked curved, just like his, but I ""warp-ed"" it in Photoshop (Edit > Transform > Warp) to remove the distortion. His Milky Way is more centered, because he was sitting about 15 feet to my left.  Style Differences: What I wanted to point out are our style differences and this is what makes NightScape photography so fun and interesting. Our composition/crop is nearly identical. We're both using the same artificial light source, the same Milky Way sky, and similar lenses. What shows up so dramatically are our style differences! Our exposures and post-processing methods are totally different. I suspect Enrique is using a lower ISO setting (probably 1600 or 3200) than I am (I was using 6400), so his slight under-exposure has picked up fewer of the fainter stars, making his brighter stars stand out more against a darker sky. His post-processing style (especially on the sky) is also different from mine. Enrique's style looks more natural (this is closer to what my eye really saw that night). My style is to produce more of the ""Hubble-telescope"" look to the skies. You may like something in between these two styles. As they say, that's what makes the world go 'round, and that's what makes this ""art""! (I'm thinking of toning-down my post-production a bit in future NightScapes, and moving a little towards Enrique's more natural style.)

In a redwood forest you sometimes find a ring of trees, all related to the tree that used to stand in the middle of the ring long ago. These ring trees are the progeny of the original tree, grown from the orginal tree's root structure. For all those who passed on in 2012, there will be a ring of trees to carry on in the new year."

They are probably one of the best-known mountain groups in the Alps. The three peaks, from east to west, are:  Cima Piccola/Kleine Zinne (""little peak"") Cima Grande/Groe Zinne (""big peak"") Cima Ovest/Westliche Zinne (""western peak"").  Until 1919 the peaks formed part of the border between Italy and Austria. Now they lie on the border between the Italian provinces of South Tyrol and Belluno and still are a part of the linguistic boundary between German-speaking and Italian-speaking majorities. The Cima Grande has an elevation of 2,999 metres (9,839 ft). It stands between the Cima Piccola, at 2,857 metres (9,373 ft), and the Cima Ovest, at 2,973 metres (9,754 ft).  Numerous routes lead from the surrounding communities to and around the peaks. The most common route is from Paternkofel/Monte Paterno to the alpine hut Auronzo at 2,333 m (7,654 ft), over Paternsattel (Patern Pass) to the alpine hut Dreizinnenhtte/Locatelli at 2,405 m (7,890 ft), and then to the peaks. There are a number of other routes as well.  Since the front line between Italy and Austria during World War I ran through these mountains, there are a number of fortifications, man-made caves, and commemorative plaques in the area."

Martin's painting explains some of the things which puzzled me in Holiday's illustration to the chapter The Vanishing. But as Holiday sometimes uses more than one source for the pictorial quotes in his illustrations, I do not know, how much and how many of my previous assumptions I will have to correct.   Holiday's reference to Martin then led me to Thomas gray. In mydailyartdisplay.wordpress.com/the-bard-by-john-martin, ""Jonathan"" connects the painting to the poem The Bard written by by Thomas Gray in 1755. Inspired by a Welsh tradition that said that Edward I had put to death any bards he found, to extinguish Welsh culture; the poem depicts the escape of a single bard:   ...   On a rock, whose haughty brow   Frowns oer cold Conways foaming flood,   Robed in the sable garb of woe   With haggard eyes the Poet stood;   ...   A Voice, as of the Cherub-Choir,   Gales from blooming Eden bear;   And distant warblings lessen on my ear,   That lost in long futurity expire.   Fond impious Man, think'st thou, yon sanguine cloud,   Rais'd by thy breath, has quench'd the Orb of day?   To-morrow he repairs the golden flood,   And warms the nations with redoubled ray.   ""Enough for me:  With joy I see   The different doom our Fates assign   Be thine Despair, and scept'red Care,   To triumph, and to die, are mine.""   He spoke, and headlong from the mountain's height   Deep in the roaring tide he plung'd to endless night.   ...

This is about The Vanishing of The Baker:   537  ""There is Thingumbob shouting!"" the Bellman said,   538    ""He is shouting like mad, only hark!   539  He is waving his hands, he is wagging his head,   540    He has certainly found a Snark!""    541  They gazed in delight, while the Butcher exclaimed   542    ""He was always a desperate wag!""   543  They beheld him--their Baker--their hero unnamed--   544    On the top of a neighbouring crag.    545  Erect and sublime, for one moment of time.   546    In the next, that wild figure they saw   547  (As if stung by a spasm) plunge into a chasm,   548    While they waited and listened in awe.  I think that there are allusions to ""Cherubic Songs by night from neighbouring Hills"" in Milton's Paradise Lost not only in Gray's ode, but also in Carroll's poem."

One of the most astonishing things I have ever seen. Ryoji Ikedas Spectra at Victoria Tower Gardens by the Palace of Westminster and Westminster Abbey on the night of August 6 2014, marking a moment of national commemoration for the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War.   From dusk to dawn for seven nights only, 49 beams of light shine high into the sky over London and can be seen from 12 miles away. At their source, you can see each individual beam, feel their heat and hear the ambient accompanying soundtrack. From a distance the lights appear as one single powerful beam, shining high up into space.   I arrived in the hour before dusk as the lights were being prepared and switched on, one by one. Around 70 people watched from this Westminster open space by the Thames before tapes around the site to allow the work to be done were removed and the public allowed to wander freely among the lights. As darkness fell and the beams became more visible, hundreds of others were attracted - like moths to a flame. Most silent in awe at this spectacle which has to be experienced in person to truly understand how amazing it is.  Official info:  A century ago, Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey declared, The lamps are going out all over Europe, we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.  100 years after Britain declared war on Germany, lights across the country were extinguished. At 11pm - the time of the declaration a century ago - a single candle remained on the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey. Simultaneously a column of white light soared into the sky over London.  A twenty-metre grid containing forty-nine searchlights installed at Victoria Tower Gardens forms spectra by Ryoji Ikeda. Unannounced, it appeared in the sky at dusk Monday August 4 2014 and for seven nights only it will be visible across the city between sunset and sunrise. People can walk within the grid of lights, experiencing a specially composed soundtrack by Ikeda. Walking through these sinewaves, a personal musical score is created for each visitor at the source of this architectural intervention in the sky.

Well . . . never could I have imagined the absolutely stunning array of colors and tones offered for viewing . . . The incredible purple shades before sunrise and the ensuing amazing ascending golden orb, which would cast a beautiful warm tone across the rivers surface had not been anticipated, and furthermore, walking up to the great overlook promenade in Weehawkins river front park offered a fabulous opportunity for photographing the distant Freedom Tower (soon to be completed) and the downtown supporting skyscrapers . . . along with the view of the Hudson River opening into Hudson Bay.  So much history could be told about that landscape/waterscape in years past. Finally, the morning ended for me with a surprising encounter with the 9-11-2001 River Front Monument, overlooking Manhattan.  It was certainly heartfelt, but awe inspiring at the same time.  The experience along the river certainly provides endless opportunities for great photography, and even if not taking photos, it is still great fun. "

The waterfalls in the mid-Blue Mountains dont receive as much publicity as the better known waterfalls in the upper Blue Mountains. Certainly, the waterfalls around Katoomba, Blackheath & Wentworth Falls are larger & more spectacular.  Also, these areas are home to awe-inspiring views, imposing clifflines, and majestic valleys like the Jamison & the Grose Valleys.  The mid mountains landscape is more intimate, but there are some hidden gems to be found around the rainforests of Lawson & Hazelbrook. Note: If youre a keen photographer you should visit these waterfalls after decent rain. Warning: some of these are rough tracks with slippery rocks so watch your footing & wear decent walking shoes or boots.     Hazelbrook is home to the well-known & much photographed Terrace Falls on the south side of the township. The Terrace Falls reserve is a short walk of a few kms through lovely rainforest & contains three waterfalls. Its possible to make this into a more interesting circuit walk by turning left at the junction with Bedford Creek. From there a short walk brings you to Bedford Pool - here you turn left & follow an un-named creek up a gully. This track contains a few cascades and brings you to Pyramid Falls & an orphan pagoda at the head of the gully. Its quite unusual to find rock pagodas in this area. From here you follow one of a couple of fire-trails back to where you started from.  For experienced walkers only: The Terrace Falls track can be combined with the South Lawson waterfall walk to provide a feast of waterfalls. Turn right at the bottom of the Terrace Falls track, follow Bedford Creek to Willawong Pool, then turn right into Lawson Creek. From there its approx. a 1.5km off-track bush-bash to reach the Sth Lawson reserve with lots of rock-hopping involved & creek crossings. Allow half a day for this circuit (or a full day if youre a serious photographer). Note: There is a fire-trail that can be used to combine these two walks, but its quite boring walking in my opinion, though much quicker.   The South Lawson waterfall reserve is an easy 3km walk that contains four waterfalls & takes you through some varied vegetation. This reserve features: Junction, Cataract, Adelina & Federal Falls.  On the north side of Lawson is the pretty Dantes Glen, Lucys Glen, & Empire Pass tracks which are among the best walks in this area. Dantes Glen has a certain ambience to it with lovely rainforest & is home to three waterfalls including Fairy Falls. Its possible to combine Dantes Glen with Empire Pass to make a great circuit walk of around 7-8kms, through a quite pristine area.  Northern Hazelbrook has a short walk of a couple of kms that features five waterfalls including Oaklands, Burgess & Horseshoe Falls. This track runs between Oaklands Rd & Winbourne Rd. Along the way is a rough overgrown track that leads to an amphitheatre area.   So around 20 waterfalls can found in several bushwalks within a few kms drive of each other in the Hazlebrook-Lawson area. Here youll find lovely patches of rainforest, impressive trees, wildflowers, colourful fungi, glow-worms, lizards, & yabbies. Enjoy!    "

When I am in extreme places I often think of possible compositions showing the human awe toward the universe. Indeed something not easy to portray... because it's mostly intimate and conceptual... in other hand this opens the field to new ideas that are also often suggested by the same location and condition in which I am spending the night. That night I've thought ""why not to introduce a human figure (in this case me) in a star trail?"". Technically this requires a double exposure, because if the star trail, as in this case, takes half an hour, it is not humanly possible to stand still for so long... so, here we have a shorter exposure at high ISO for the human subject and its surroundings (stones, light pollution from the plain), which is mathematically proportional to a second 30 minutes exposure at lower ISO for the stars. As usual for this kind of shots: manual focusing, tripod, mirror lock up, timer, remote shutter release. The result is something much more important of the arid details written above, yes, it's what I was hoping for: a man who contemplates the cosmic movement. Specifically, the Milky Way trail of light (center image). As always, ideas are able to overcome physical and material limits :-) Being this taken in the month of September, the Milky Way at the beginning of the night no longer points exactly towards the south, rather a bit more southwest. This excluded any possibility to have again the distant north face of Monte Viso aligned with the Great Rift sector, as in previous shots of mine taken in June. In any case, the mountain range in the distance belongs to the natural park Orsiera-Rocciavr. Light pollution always comes from the city of Susa, which lies 3.000 meters below. _____________________ Roberto Bertero, All Rights Reserved.

The artistry in the creation of each piece was simply amazing.  The rainbow of colors made this a perfect miniature Christmas Tree to accentuate the area by the falls.   We wanted to share our experience of the visit to Longwood Gardens 2014 Christmas Spectacular (the main theme this year is BIRDS).  The festivities begin on Thanksgiving Day and continue through the end of the first week of 2015.  In recent years, we have found that it works perfectly for us to go on Thanksgiving Day, for we would celebrate TG early and afterward.  This allows an opening day attendance at Longwood, where the crowd is significantly less than during the peak weekend days.  There will be a good number of photos to view, and for the most part, presented in correct sequence.  Please check out our ALBUMS titled LONGWOOD GARDENS of Kennett Square, PA and/or CHRISTMAS SCENES for a better flow in exploring the photos, since the continuity is lost when uploading into FLICKR while many others are doing the same, thus, having a variety of shots mixed in between the ones representing our visit on this day.    The wide variety of flowers and plants at Longwood Gardens are absolutely stunning in all stages and species . . . truly a Garden of Eden for anyone with a deep passion for these gifts of nature.  The annual Longwood Gardens Christmas never fails to awe the visitors with one spectacular display after another.  Whether these are in the magnificently elegant grand Conservatory, or outdoors within the over 1,000 acres of fabulous grounds, each and every thing is meticulously planned and designed, always arriving at some fresh ideas and/or concepts, while also maintaining the traditionally classic holiday floral and lighting appointments throughout.  Given that the main theme for the 2014 holiday season is BIRDS, this can be seen in such spectacularly tasteful fashion throughout the displays of the vast indoor landscape.  From the moment one enters the architectural marvel of the Conservatory, whether through the main Orangery or the East Conservatory, an awe inspiring view awaits. "

I happened upon a small beach which I had never been and was lucky enough to be there at the right time.  The day was uncommon of the season, the temperature was near 70F/21c and the air was still. It was so quiet, it was almost eerie.   As the sun fell below the horizon, and the darkness started to take hold, the color was revealed and it felt like the whole beach was glowing in soft pastels, as the color was projected from the skies and reflected back up from the water, it was surreal.  While I did take a few pictures, I can say that I spent more time just standing in awe at the beauty before me. I couldn't help but lose myself in it.   We are constantly being bombarded by news and stories of the ugliness in our world and  if we just wait another 5 minutes, we will be told why it is we are going to more than likely die if we keep eating that peanut butter, you know, the one that we've been eating all our life?   So, we sit and wait for this dire information and as we wait, we are told how incomplete our lives are because we aren't using ""this"" toilet paper and if we did, it would seem that all of our problems would be solved... then we are reminded by another person to ask our doctor about a some pill or cream that will put hair back on your head, never mind that it is possible you will get cancer, bleed through the eyes or parts or it will make everything you eat taste like the insides of a dung beetle..   Standing on that shore, I was reminded of the beauty which surrounds us every day. It doesn't cost a thing, you don't have to see a doctor to enjoy the benefits and it won't make your body parts sluff off as a side effect..  "

Once the sun sets on the three hundred square miles of rugged wilderness that is the Galloway Forest Park, under an inky-blue sky they become the darkest in all of Europe.

Being able to view the twinkling star-studded sky is a uniquely human pleasure, that if we are not careful, may slip from our grasp in most parts of the world due to increasing light pollution.

It was the ancestral home of the Campbells of Glen Orchy, who later became the Earls of Breadalbane also known as the Breadalbane family branch, of the Clan Campbell. The earliest construction on the castle was the towerhouse and Laich Hall (looks onto Loch Awe). Today, its picturesque setting and romantic state of decay make it one of the most photographed structures in Scotland.   History   Kilchurn Castle was built in about 1450 by Sir Colin Campbell, first Lord of Glenorchy, as a five storey tower house with a courtyard defended by an outer wall. By about 1500 an additional range and a hall had been added to the south side of the castle. Further buildings went up during the 16th and 17th centuries. Kilchurn was on a small island in Loch Awe scarcely larger than the castle itself, although it is now connected to the mainland as the water level was altered in 1817. The castle would have been accessed via an underwater or low lying causeway.[1][2]   At the turn of the 16th century Kilchurn Castle was extended by Sir Duncan Campbell with the addition of a single storey dining hall built along the inside of the south curtain. During the second half of the century, another Sir Colin Campbell, the 6th Laird, continued to improve the castle's accommodation by adding some chambers to the north of the tower house, and remodelling the parapet. This included the introduction of the circular corner turrets adorned by corbels, most of which have survived remarkably well.   Towards the end of the 16th century the Clan MacGregor of Glenstrae were occupying the castle. Once owning the lands of Glenorchy during the 14th century, until they passed through marriage to the Campbells, the MacGregors were appointed keepers to Kilchurn Castle as the Campbells spent much of their time at Fincharn. This arrangement lasted until the very early part of the 17th century, when a violent feud between the two families brought it to an end and the Campbells retook possession.   In 1681, Sir John Campbell of Glenorchy was made 1st Earl of Breadalbane. To take advantage of the turbulence of the times, he converted Kilchurn into a modern barracks, capable of housing 200 troops. His main addition was the three storey L-shaped block along the north side.   Engraving of Kilchurn Castle by William Miller, 1846  Kilchurn was then used as a Government garrison during the 1715 and 1745 Jacobite risings. The Campbells attempted, unsuccessfully, to sell Kilchurn to the government, after they moved in 1740 to Taymouth Castle in Perthshire.   In 1760, the castle was badly damaged by lightning and was completely abandoned; the remains of a turret of a tower, still resting upside-down in the centre of the courtyard, attest to the violence of the storm.   William Turner's watercolour Midday depicts the castle amidst the weather conditions and the geology of Scotland. It was created in 1802.   The ruin is currently in the care of Historic Scotland, and is open to the public during the summer. Access, during summer only, is by either by boat from Lochawe pier, or on foot from Dalmally. Both points are on the A85 road. During 2006 and 2007 there was an access problem to the castle. Network Rail, in accordance with their policy of blocking foot crossings on railway lines, closed the crossing to Kilchurn, effectively removing land access. However in 2007 access via the nearby viaduct was created, restoring landward access once more "

Mount Everest towers above the Khumbu at over 8,848 m and is perhaps the most iconic symbol of challenge and adventure on Earth. EBC treks follow in the footsteps of legends as we ascend from verdant Lukla to the vast glaciers and razor-sharp ridgelines of the Everest Himalayas; home of the worlds highest peaks. At Base Camp, stand face-to-face with the fabled Khumbu Ice Fall and its towering seracs. Hike to the summit of Kala Patar at over 5,550mtr for an unobstructed view of Everests windblown summit, trailing a seemingly perpetual banner of cloud and snow. The treks take you into the heart of the Nepalese Himalaya, with awe-inspiring views of many of the worlds highest and most beautiful mountains. www.himalayanepaltrek.com "

It is the longest freshwater loch in Scotland, measuring 41 kilometres (25 mi) from end to end with an average width of 1-kilometre (0.62 mi). The loch runs approximately south-west to north-east, roughly parallel to the two sea lochs of Loch Etive and Loch Fyne. Via the River Awe and Loch Etive it drains westward from its northern end and thus into the Atlantic Ocean. At the narrowest section of the loch are North Port (Taychreggan Hotel) and South Port (Portsonachan Hotel). Once used by cattle drovers, a ferry ran between these shores to facilitate crossing to markets beyond. The Transatlantic Cable, which runs through the village of Kilchrenan, was laid across at this point in 1955."

A huge car park full of tour buses and dark overcrowded visitors centre didn't really thrill us but then we came to the cliffs ...awe inspiring. A quarter of mile walk along the cliff tops we were practically on our own to enjoy the cliffs in peace :)

The weather was looking very dodgy with cirrus clouds up until around 10pm, and then it cleared up completely for the rest of the night until sunrise (besides a few hazy spots every now and then).  It was so beautiful, never before have I ever seen such a sky, I just set my exposures on my CCD and walked around outside my dome staring up in complete awe shouting inaudibles.  Constellations are hard to pick out because everything's so damn bright!  It had a real 3d effect.  Kinda chilly but very well worth it.  This image is a stack of 8 images: 3x1200second, 3x900second, and 2x600second for just a little over 2 hours total."

Their display of asters is one of the best in the country.  The English herbaceous border in full flower is a breath taking and awe inspiring sight. When done on a grand scale its a true marvel of what skilled designers and gardeners can achieve. To construct an herbaceous border on the scale shown in these photos requires sufficient space, adequate manpower and resources and detailed horticultural knowledge too.  Although this type of border was at its most popular in the grand English gardens of the late 19th and early 20th centuries there are still some magnificent examples to be found in present day UK gardens. I have attempted to capture some of the variety in the English herbaceous border in this set of photographs.  The original grand borders were greatly influenced by the artist, gardener and writer Gertrude Jekyll, who wrote the classic work on this subject Colour Schemes in the Flower Garden in 1908. The true herbaceous border is currently something of a rarity as most English flower borders now contain a mixture of both shrubs and herbaceous perennials. Sometimes annuals are also added to give an extended flowering season and to fill gaps left by plants that have gone over. So most borders in English gardens are now mixed rather than just herbaceous.  However for pure spectacle, the herbaceous border at its peak is simply unbeatable!    2014 ukgardenphotos  "

Depending on the season, lucky visitors may also see acquatic mammals such as whales and dolphins.  For many years, the Ballestas Islands were a major money-making enterprise for the Peruvian people. This is because bird poop, known more formally as guano, is one of the most potent and popular forms of fertilizer in the world.   The millions of marine birds on the islands produce a fair amount of the stuff every year - in the hundreds of tons - and enterprising people used to collect the guano and sell it."

The heavy oak beams in the cloister are believed to have come from the (then) recently broken up wooden battleships,  HMS Caledonia and HMS Duke of Wellington.  It has an eccentric blend of church styles, from ancient Roman to Norman and it was built of local stone.  It consists of a nave and chancel, with the chancel-stalls being canopied.  Large, unsmoothed boulders of granite from nearby Ben Cruachan, form the piers which carry the chancel arch, and the transepts make the Sacred Cross."

Although far beyond the peak season of May through early July, we decided to take a drive over after visiting Duke Farms (see our ALBUMS) during a late mid-August day.   We had been told about this lovely garden by a number of folks we had met over a week period earlier that month, and since the descriptions were consistently very appealingbased on peak season, in each casewe felt it would be worth the 6 or 7 miles from Duke Farms, for we had nothing to lose.  Basically, we just wanted to get an idea as to the general layout of the place for future consideration.  We were a bit skeptical in terms of expectations, having been spoiled by numerous visits to Longwood Gardens (see ALBUM for this site, too) in PAperhaps the greatest garden in North America with its over 1,000 acres of spectacular displays. Well, upon arriving later that day, we could instantly tell that this new garden would be special.  From the parking area, once notices the elegant layout of the enclosed rose garden, and even at this time of year, it was evident from a distance that many roses were still quite nice.  As we approached the gate, the roses still peaking were simply stunning.  Granted, not Longwood Gardens in scale, but with a focus on roses, it is definitely first class, and we could easily see the incredible passion administered by the gardeners and horticulturists.  Many of these roses were given official names, designated as unique species.  Most fell under the families of Grandiflora and Floribunda Roses, and for the most part, my wife was very diligent about notating the exact names and families.  I, on the other hand, was somewhat remiss in that several truly wonderful roses photographed toward the latter part of this visit were without detailed IDs.   Anyhow, we can only imagine what the scenery might be during the peak blooms, and we definitely intend to return to experience it.  For those residing in the New Jersey or Eastern PA regions, this is a MUST SEE place.  And if roses are amongst your favorite flowers, you will be in awe. "

From dusk to dawn for seven nights only, 49 beams of light shine high into the sky over London and can be seen from 12 miles away. At their source, you can see each individual beam, feel their heat and hear the ambient accompanying soundtrack. From a distance the lights appear as one single powerful beam, shining high up into space.   I again arrived in the hour before dusk as the lights were being prepared and switched on, one by one. Around 150 people watched from this Westminster open space by the Thames before tapes around the site to allow the work to be done were removed and the public allowed to wander freely among the lights. As darkness fell and the beams became more visible, hundreds of others were attracted - like moths to a flame. Most silent in awe at this spectacle which has to be experienced in person to truly understand how amazing it is.  Official info:  A century ago, Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey declared, The lamps are going out all over Europe, we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.  100 years after Britain declared war on Germany, lights across the country were extinguished. At 11pm - the time of the declaration a century ago - a single candle remained on the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey. Simultaneously a column of white light soared into the sky over London.  A twenty-metre grid containing forty-nine searchlights installed at Victoria Tower Gardens forms spectra by Ryoji Ikeda. Unannounced, it appeared in the sky at dusk Monday August 4 2014 and for seven nights only it will be visible across the city between sunset and sunrise. People can walk within the grid of lights, experiencing a specially composed soundtrack by Ikeda. Walking through these sinewaves, a personal musical score is created for each visitor at the source of this architectural intervention in the sky.

awe,http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3698/9292804266_21ca16d4b6_z.jpg,1,4,"Earth In Transit: The Rain Year - Clouds and Clouds and Clouds For the past 20 years or so there's been a lot of talk and tension about climate change here on our planet.  We've called it ""Global Warming"".  The Polar ice caps are melting at alarming rates. The northern and southern extremes of the oceans are being markedly cooled with the inundation of polar ice.  That cooling is gradually making its way to the equator.  The cooling oceans will then change their currents and the weather follows suit.  If the Gulf stream cools enough, massive changes in weather will occur. They already are.  Make no mistake those changes are already underway.  It is no longer an abstract possibility - we have seen the affects and will continue to see ""extreme' weather as the Earth recalibrates it's currents and weather patterns.  Yet another possibility has been offered as well.  These massive and powerful changes in the weather have ancient precedents.  They've happened before.  Global warming is not the final effect, in iteself, but is part of a larger cycle. The warming period is a precursor to a cooling off.  In some cases this has resulted in Ice Ages, in others longer, more severe winters only.  It's been suggested that once the warming period has melted enough polar ice to significantly cool and change water currents and air streams, there'll be a 20 - 25 year ""Mini Ice Age"".  This coming period, as hypothesized, could well be the best thing that's happened to the Earth in over 100 years, even though the path there might be a bit dramatic.  The cooling oceans will be able to purify and refresh themselves.  This, in turn, re-works and re-vivifies the great winds of the planet.  It's happened before.  It's cyclical and it's natural.  These images of a golden aftermath of one of the summer of 13's larger thunderstorms are remarkable for the impressive amounts of mists and even ""clouds"" that rose up off the ground and filled the air as the sun was setting.  In the 5 years I've been taking shots of sunsets off my balcony here, I've never seen anything like this.  It was awe-inspiring and beautiful, creating light and shadow effects that were quite rich and dramatic.  I'm glad I was able to be home that evening and capture it.

The awe-inspiring Rio Celeste (Light Blue River) is turned literally blue due to the emanation of sulfur from the volcano and precipitation of calcium carbonate.

According to legend, it was here, in the awe-inspiring basin at the mountain's summit, that the demigod Maui snared the sun, releasing it only after it promised to move more slowly across the sky. Haleakal means ""house of the sun""; the park encompasses the basin and portions of the volcano's flanks.  A United Nations International Biosphere Reserve, the park comprises starkly contrasting worlds of mountain and coast. The road to the summit of Haleakal rises from near sea level to 10,023 feet in 38 milespossibly the steepest such gradient for autos in the world. Visitors ascend through several climate and vegetation zones, from humid subtropical lowlands to subalpine desert. Striking plants and animals such as the Haleakal silversword and the nn may be seen in this mountain section.  The summit-area depression, misnamed Haleakal Crater, formed as erosion ate away the mountain, joining two valleys. This 19-square-mile wilderness area, 2,720 feet deep, is the park's major draw.  From east of the rim, the great rain forest valley of Kpahulu drops thousands of feet down to the coast. The upper Kpahulu Valley is a biological reserve (no public access), home to a vast profusion of flora and fauna, including some of the world's rarest birds, plants, and invertebrates. Some insects and plants evolved in the Kpahulu Valley and live nowhere else. "

Thegrowth of some of the suburbs is phenomenal.For example, Charlottenburg, with a population oftwenty thousand in 1890, numbers nearly threehundred thousand in this year of grace.

Here, at Richard DeKorte Park, especially by the mudflats or inlets at lower tides, the play between the setting suns residual gradation of pre-twilight warm tones on the water surface creates an interesting texture and effect.  Whether the supporting cast be the feeding water fowls, post birdhouses, foot prints on the mudflats, the distant towers of the power lines, or the silhouette of the hills and trees beyond, the view is always captivating . . . And when the light conditions of the Golden Hour (aka, Magic Hour) are perfect, there is nothing like the distant skyline of Downtown New York, with the awe-inspiring Freedom Tower,  standing proudly where the Twin Towers once stood.  Combining the spire broadcast antenna with the building itself, this becomes the tallest structure in America and third tallest in the world.  An LED-powered light will be emitted from this spire and shall be seen from many miles away . . . The vast number of birds, both migratory and resident, enables anyone who enjoys the wonders of these winged friends a great experience whenever visiting Richard DeKorte Park, a quiet, almost hidden, sanctuary of wildlife, practically a stone throw away from Manhattan.  The variety of bird and plant species is incredible, so if one is appreciative of such, then learning something new is pretty much the norm here.  In addition, a wealth of insect species are present, each with its own unique traits that always keeps things interesting, and the furry, adorable critters such as the muskrats and groundhogs, to name a few, along with several kinds of turtles, including quite large snappers provide visitors endless opportunities to experience the fascinating world of nature.  Contrary to common perception amongst the general populace, we truly  believe that the wildflowers (often called weeds) are as beautiful as the popular strands.  And the Meadowlands certainly has a multitude of wild species for visitors to admire.   Seasonal changes do present fresh new looks . . . So, getting bored is difficult. "

It is short and squat, and rarely exceeds 815 metres (2649 ft) in height. However, the Pisciottana, a unique variety comprising 40,000 trees found only in the area around Pisciotta in the Campania region of southern Italy often exceeds 815 metres (2649 ft) with correspondingly large trunk diameters. The silvery green leaves are oblong, measuring 410 centimetres (1.63.9 in) long and 13 centimetres (0.391.2 in) wide. The trunk is typically gnarled and twisted. The small white, feathery flowers, with ten-cleft calyx and corolla, two stamens and bifid stigma, are borne generally on the previous year's wood, in racemes springing from the axils of the leaves. The fruit is a small drupe 12.5 centimetres (0.390.98 in) long, thinner-fleshed and smaller in wild plants than in orchard cultivars. Olives are harvested in the green to purple stage.

The roughly circular crater floor is 770 metres (2,530 ft) x 900 metres (2,950 ft) and is 83 metres (270 ft) below the floor of Klauea caldera. Halemaumau in Hawaiian mythology is home to Pele, Hawaiian Goddess of Fire and Volcanoes. The view at dusk just begins to show the fiery glow of the molten lava.

For hundreds of years the area has been famous for its King Arthur legend, including the historic castle on the cliffs. For more than 800 years a magical tale has been told that Tintagel was the birthplace of the noble King Arthur.   He was protected from evil by Merlin the magician who lived below the castle in a cave.   As many mysteries remain about Tintagel as facts are known. Today the two are inextricably entwined and the village remains one of the most awe inspiring and romantic spots in the UK.   The castle is found in the spectacular setting of the dramatic north Cornwall coast. Atlantic breakers crash against the cliffs, and through Merlin's cave, as visitors climb the steep but breathtaking path to Tintagel Island.   The ruins of the 13th Century stronghold of the Earls of Cornwall continue to be explored by people from all over the world.   On the mainland itself, the gaunt remains of the medieval castle represent only one phase in a long history of occupation.   TINTAGEL CASTLE HISTORY   Even before Richard, Earl of Cornwall, built his castle, Tintagel had come to be associated with the conception of King Arthur.   During the summer months, a story-teller is often on hand to bring the legends of King Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot to life. In the bleak mid-winter, Tintagel is a place that inspires the imagination of writers and poets. It's a place of dreams, romance and legend.   In June 1998, excavations were undertaken under the direction of Professor Chris Morris of the University of Glasgow, on a relatively sheltered and small site on the eastern side of the island, first excavated in the 1930s.  Pottery from the 5th and 6th centuries was found, as well as some fine glass fragments believed to be from 6th- or 7th-century Mlaga.   Even more remarkable was a 1,500-year-old piece of slate on which remain two Latin inscriptions. The second inscription reads: Artognou, father of a descendant of Coll, has had [this] made. Who exactly Artognou was continues to be a subject for lively speculation."

Some of these renowned sights are the Arena, sixth largest in the world or Twin Gates, the Temple of Augustus, the well-preserved Roman Forum or the Communal Palace. However, not as much information is known about the impressive heritage of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy dating from the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, undoubtedly a real cultural and historic treasure. In fact, this refers to entire Pula, which from 1820 to 1916 was being architecturally shaped as a fortified town. Once the major naval port of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy Pula, together with its surroundings, has kept for over a century 26 magnificent forts or fortifications, as well as 8 artillery batteries, about 60 batteries, trenches, underground tunnels and many other points of interest. The outer ring of Pula's fortifications covers an area of 40,000 hectares and according to legend all forts were interconnected by a network of underground tunnels. Especially interesting is the story according to which Fort Marie Louise at Muzil was connected with the fort on the Brijuni islands by an underwater tunnel.  Pula's fortifications were designed to defend the city from possible attacks from the sea and were built to resist every possible attack - for this reason they were mostly circular or ring-like so that shells could rebound off the walls. They were all built at excellent locations, mostly lookouts that even today offer a magnificent view.  The fortifications of Pula and its surroundings were never used for a specific attack and defense of the city, although according to some sources, in 1915 Pula's garrison consisted of as many as 1,410 officers and over 51 thousand soldiers. Owing to the fact that the forts were never attacked from the sea, today Pula has a completely preserved significant fortification complex. "

She was talking about how shed reached a point of shocking realization that whenever anything cool happened, she would think in posts, basically meaning shed start composing a tweet or pulling up Instagram to capture the moment.  I can really connect with this. I have had many moments in life where Im just in awe of Gods glory, oftentimes when Im alone in nature or after being with loved ones. Those moments are so personal and sacred, but sometimes, as strange as it sounds, I kill them by beginning to devise a post in my head. I start thinking about how Ill phrase it, if people will like it, if Ill get any comments in response. And by the time all thats done, the  moment is gone.  Ive realized how simply sad it is to be a slave to social media. And Im ashamed to say it, but I have definitely used Facebook and Instagram in the past as a place to give myself glory, to create an identity for myself that others will appreciate. And its such a bummer that there have been incredible, personal moments with God in my life that have ended as a couple hundred characters and a few hashtags just because I wanted to see what other people think of me, what they think of my life.  Theres a scene in the movie The Secret Life of Walter Mitty that struck a similar chord in me. Walter Mitty had been searching for this photographer Sean OConnell the whole movie, and hes finally found him perched up in a mountain, scouting for snow leopards through a lens the size of a cannon. Eventually, a snow leopard is seen through the lens, framed beautifully by snow capped peaks. Walter watches in eager expectation, waiting for OConnell to take the shot. Finally, anxious that the moment is about to pass, Walter turns and asks:  When are you going to take it?  To which OConnell replies: Sometimes I dont. If I like a moment, for me, personally, I dont like to have the distraction of the camera. I just want to stay in it.  Stay in it?  Yeah. Right there. Right here.  There are so many incredible places and people all around me, so many blessings and moments that I cant even fathom. When I stayed on an orphanage in Nicaragua for a month last Summer, Id go out for these prayer times where Id sit on a work bench, all alone, and just pray surrounded by ridiculous testaments to Gods wondrous ability to create. I remember one time I was just resting on that bench, relaxing in Gods presence, surrounded by beautiful mango trees that rustled as a light breeze filtered by. And I am so thankful I didnt have my camera then, because there was overwhelming beauty all around me and nothing to take my attention off of it.  I dont want to think in posts. I dont want to be constantly checking to see what people think of my latest photo, or my latest status. Sometimes, Ive just gotta turn off my radio, turn off my iPod, turn off my phone, and just be thankful, engaged with life and engaged with God. Because I know when I do that, I feel fulfilled in the most amazing way."

I could head back to Bures from there.   The rain stayed off, but the amount of surface water was now a problem - I have mudguards, but some roads were flooded, and although cars were rare around here it would only take one overtaking carelessly to soak me. Without incident I entered Pebmarsh, which turned out to be a largish, long village, and in the oldest part of it I reached the church.  Open. This church is quite different from the others I had visited so far. They were all, in their way, typical small Essex churches. Pebmarsh is a typical large East Anglian church. It is BIG. It has aisles and a clerestory, and castellated walls, so would be quite at home in west Suffolk or south-east Cambridgeshire. To give it an Essex signature it has a perky wooden turret at the top of the tower as at Finchingfield and Felsted.   I don't know of a church more difficult to photograph from the south; it sits within a wide bend, hard against the churchyard wall and high above the village street. The best I could do was to wander down the street opposite, but trees and a telegraph pole quickly impeded the view.  Inside, it is like the bones of a church: the considerable 19th Century restoration stripped the plaster from the walls, exposing the flints internally as at Hildersham in Cambridgeshire.  It is rather striking, as you may imagine.  There is good 19th and 20th Century glass, as well as some 13th century survivals including a figure of St Peter holding his keys at a jaunty angle, but the star of the show here is the 1330s brass to Sir William Fitzralph, generally considered the most important brass in Essex, and one of the earliest martial brasses in England. I'm not a great one for brasses, but it is pretty awe-inspiring."

Access to the Castle is sometimes restricted by higher-than-usual levels of water in the Loch, at which times the site effectively becomes a temporary island. The Castle was built in about 1450 by Sir Colin Campbell, first Lord of Glenorchy, as a five storey tower house with a courtyard defended by an outer wall.  By about 1500 an additional range and a hall had been added to the south side of the castle. Further buildings went up during the 16th and 17th centuries.  Kilchurn was on a small island in Loch Awe scarcely larger than the castle itself, although it is now connected to the mainland as the water level was altered in 1817.  The Castle would have been accessed via an underwater or low lying causeway."

I camped atop a hill centered  in isolated desert country east of El Paso, Texas on my birthday which had the benefit of a second ""blue moon"" on Dec. 31, 1990.

I stared with awe as it continued to climb. The mountain seemed to give a little wiggle as the moon popped free above it, almost as if the earth was giving birth to the moon.

Alana and I were on our way to try our second attempt on Crescent spire after being rained off the previous day when the boys caught up to us. Thanks to our rappelling mis-adventure we all got back onto the glacier around the same time that night. Ken's optimism paid off because the clouds all burned off and they had a successful ascent.   The Bugaboos - August 12-18, 2012  Living in Squamish I am very lucky to be surrounded by excellent rock to train my technical climbing skills as well as many great peaks for scrambling. But, until last week I had never had the opportunity to combine the two skills I've been developing for years. That all changed when a friend invited me to be her partner on the yearly trip my friend group takes. Two months after the invitiation, a partner swap, and a week of careful packing and preparation I actually found myself driving east about to embark on what would be the greatest adventure of my life to date.   The moment I arrived at basecamp my lofty climbing aspiration were downgraded to starting with a 4th class route and going from there. I received tons of advice from friends that had been going for several years, but still nothing could have prepared me for the reality of being there. The ascent to Applebee basecamp, the scale of the spires, the difficulty of the glaciers, and the exposure did not translate well to maps and photos I found myself in awe and terror. Every single obstacle I encountered was more physically and mentally demanding that I could have expected.   Even though we were with a large group of friends, we were on our own when we headed out for the day and often learning as we went. As a result we learned many lessons the hard way, including when to put crampons on, when to switch into rock shoes, how hard preventing rockfall can be, and all the ways rappelling can go wrong.   It was both the single most terrifying and rewarding experience of my life. Never did I expect to learn so much in a week, or do so little actual climbing. Instead it was a wild ride of alpine obstacles, and a truly life changing experience shared with great friends old and new.   A brief summary of my adventure:  Aug 12 - Hike into Applebee base camp with 80+lbs pack full of climbing, camping, and glacier gear as well as 7 days of food, and clothes for everything from -10 to +30 degrees celcius rain and shine. Aug 13 - Eastpost spire, combination of Northeast and Northwest ridges. Aug 14 - Crescent Spire, W ridge. - Rained off first attempt, after self arresting and improv. anchor construction. Aug 15 - Crescent Spire, W ridge - Successful ascent followed by rappelling disaster involving ditching a rope that was later recovered Aug 16 - Pigeon Spire, W ridge - Got 30m up route then turned back to save terror management skills for descent back down the Bugaboo-Snowpatch col Aug 17 - Eastpost spire again and bathing in the tarn Aug 18 - Hike out and long drive home  Please feel free to contact me with any questions regarding my experience.  Photos from this trip were taken with a combination of my Nikon D7000, Olympus uT8000 & GoPro HD2"

Nonetheless, the hike in new territory seeing and being in a new space is always good for the mind. After my journey to Monteverde, I went to the small town of La Fortuna. On my departing journey from Monteverde, there had to be at least 15 rainbows or ""arcoiris"" ...incredible. The locals there find it comical when others marvel at the rainbows...its a common occurrence in Monteverde...with clear skies and rainbows galore...it set the pace for my descending trip from the cloud forest. La Fortuna's landscape is dominated by Volcn Arenal. I was told 80% of people who visit La Fortuna actually get to see the full view of the volcano as there are too many clouds. I was fotunate to be able to see the whole thing and wow what a sight. If you havent seen a volcano as I hadn't, it is awe inspiring, such a massive feature in the landscape. After sleeping a night, the next day I hiked around the Volcano and got to see a nice view of the valley and Lake.

Spread over 4 Days, the 44 km trail through the Andes crosses three stunning high passes and encounters many ancient archaeological sities, culminating at the famous Lost City of the Incas. There are few treks in the world that combine natural beatuty, history and mystery with such an awe-inspiring final destination. The trek is led by a local guide and supported by team of porters and cooks, leaving you with only a small day pack to carry. The trail can be demanding but can be completed by anyone who leads a reasonably active life - you certainly don't need to be an expert! The trail is not rushed and everyone is able to walk at their own pace. If you are in any doubt, or if you have any condition that may affect your ability to trek, we advise that you consult your doctor. www.tierrasvivas.com"

Denied an interview for the local art school, he produced hundreds of drawings that gained him entry to Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design. However, his defiance of authority and his insistence on integrity led to his eventual expulsion. Then began his artistic, literary and musical odyssey. Billy Childish has a cult status worldwide, with solo and group exhibitions internationally, including New York, London, Seoul and Berlin. In 2011 he became Artist in Residence at the Chatham Historic Dockyard where he currently works.

Haleakal means ""house of the sun""; the park encompasses the basin and portions of the volcano's flanks.  A United Nations International Biosphere Reserve, the park comprises starkly contrasting worlds of mountain and coast. The road to the summit of Haleakal rises from near sea level to 10,023 feet in 38 milespossibly the steepest such gradient for autos in the world. Visitors ascend through several climate and vegetation zones, from humid subtropical lowlands to subalpine desert. Striking plants and animals such as the Haleakal silversword and the nn may be seen in this mountain section.  The summit-area depression, misnamed Haleakal Crater, formed as erosion ate away the mountain, joining two valleys. This 19-square-mile wilderness area, 2,720 feet deep, is the park's major draw.  From east of the rim, the great rain forest valley of Kpahulu drops thousands of feet down to the coast. The upper Kpahulu Valley is a biological reserve (no public access), home to a vast profusion of flora and fauna, including some of the world's rarest birds, plants, and invertebrates. Some insects and plants evolved in the Kpahulu Valley and live nowhere else. "

The locals there find it comical when others marvel at the rainbows...its a common occurrence in Monteverde...with clear skies and rainbows galore...it set the pace for my descending trip from the cloud forest. La Fortuna's landscape is dominated by Volcn Arenal. I was told 80% of people who visit La Fortuna actually get to see the full view of the volcano as there are too many clouds. I was fotunate to be able to see the whole thing and wow what a sight. If you havent seen a volcano as I hadn't, it is awe inspiring, such a massive feature in the landscape.

awe,http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7445/9159089106_23344dc6a1_z.jpg,2,3,"Fred W Symmes Chapel This was the last morning of the trip for Darren and I. We had been late getting to a hotel in Brevard, NC the previous night to get cleaned up from our trip up to Gregory Bald and some strenuous climbing around waterfalls in tropical like humidity. We were probably starting to stink, and hadn't had any decent sleep really since the first night. There had been a heavy thunderstorm in SC that evening though we never drove through it, our last waterfall visit of Twin Falls was treacherous and under extreme flow from the event with downed trees everywhere.   It would have been real easy for me to sleep in this morning after getting to bed so late again. I did sleep really well despite the buzzing activity around the hotel, and getting to the chapel would be a 1/2 hour drive so we got up around 5:30 I think. Seeing this place had been one of the primary goals of our trip, and upon exiting the hotel we were in a thick fog. I figured that meant the lower elevations so one probably couldn't go wrong at any higher vantage point in the area.  We arrived at the camp with plenty of time to spare and noted a few kids walking down the road near the chapel. There is a gate and a 1/4 mile walk the last leg. We got out and started running, hoping to beat the kids and set up a composition figuring they were just a few strays. That turned out being wrong, the whole camp ended up coming down for a sunrise viewing activity. The counselors said it would be alright for us to take pictures, but the kids moving around would have made it tough to get anything, something that would have been tough to swallow given the lost sleep and epic conditions of the morning.  They all got quiet and waited for the sunrise, and Darren and I sat down with them. They were all still and it was a peaceful moment, pretty awe inspiring with the view and beauty of this place. I thought of my own childhood, I never went away to any summer camp, but how fortunate these kids were to be here and what a good time they must be having up in the mountains rather than the inferno that Greenville must be this time of year.   The moment the sun broke up over the horizon, a counselor got up and said it was time to go. Darren got a chuckle over this, and it was sort of funny. Most of them filed out in an orderly manner, and then the best light appeared due to a cloud masking the sun. The light played off the fog in the valleys beautifully. This time of year the sunrise is well north, so I liked this offset angle of the view rather than straight down the aisle like most comps here. We had hit this on the perfect morning, if I lived in the area I'd probably be here most of them.  This was 5 images luminosity masked, the interior, the near mountain, the fog, and 2 for the sky. It may appear as if I lightened the area on the beam with scripture, but that is the natural flow of the light as the interior is one even exposure. This was a good way to end the trip, or at least start heading for home while seeing waterfalls on the way back. I am getting extremely disappointed with Flickr and the lack of participation that appears to be accelerating. I am likely not going to put out photos here much longer, but you can still see them on my Facebook page Landscapes of the Blue Ridge"

The artistry in the creation of each piece was simply amazing.  The rainbow of colors made this a perfect miniature Christmas Tree to accentuate the area by the falls.   We wanted to share our experience of the visit to Longwood Gardens 2014 Christmas Spectacular (the main theme this year is BIRDS).  The festivities begin on Thanksgiving Day and continue through the end of the first week of 2015.  In recent years, we have found that it works perfectly for us to go on Thanksgiving Day, for we would celebrate TG early and afterward.  This allows an opening day attendance at Longwood, where the crowd is significantly less than during the peak weekend days.  There will be a good number of photos to view, and for the most part, presented in correct sequence.  Please check out our ALBUMS titled LONGWOOD GARDENS of Kennett Square, PA and/or CHRISTMAS SCENES for a better flow in exploring the photos, since the continuity is lost when uploading into FLICKR while many others are doing the same, thus, having a variety of shots mixed in between the ones representing our visit on this day.    The wide variety of flowers and plants at Longwood Gardens are absolutely stunning in all stages and species . . . truly a Garden of Eden for anyone with a deep passion for these gifts of nature.  The annual Longwood Gardens Christmas never fails to awe the visitors with one spectacular display after another.  Whether these are in the magnificently elegant grand Conservatory, or outdoors within the over 1,000 acres of fabulous grounds, each and every thing is meticulously planned and designed, always arriving at some fresh ideas and/or concepts, while also maintaining the traditionally classic holiday floral and lighting appointments throughout.  Given that the main theme for the 2014 holiday season is BIRDS, this can be seen in such spectacularly tasteful fashion throughout the displays of the vast indoor landscape.  From the moment one enters the architectural marvel of the Conservatory, whether through the main Orangery or the East Conservatory, an awe inspiring view awaits. "

I could head back to Bures from there.   The rain stayed off, but the amount of surface water was now a problem - I have mudguards, but some roads were flooded, and although cars were rare around here it would only take one overtaking carelessly to soak me. Without incident I entered Pebmarsh, which turned out to be a largish, long village, and in the oldest part of it I reached the church.  Open. This church is quite different from the others I had visited so far. They were all, in their way, typical small Essex churches. Pebmarsh is a typical large East Anglian church. It is BIG. It has aisles and a clerestory, and castellated walls, so would be quite at home in west Suffolk or south-east Cambridgeshire. To give it an Essex signature it has a perky wooden turret at the top of the tower as at Finchingfield and Felsted.   I don't know of a church more difficult to photograph from the south; it sits within a wide bend, hard against the churchyard wall and high above the village street. The best I could do was to wander down the street opposite, but trees and a telegraph pole quickly impeded the view.  Inside, it is like the bones of a church: the considerable 19th Century restoration stripped the plaster from the walls, exposing the flints internally as at Hildersham in Cambridgeshire.  It is rather striking, as you may imagine.  There is good 19th and 20th Century glass, as well as some 13th century survivals including a figure of St Peter holding his keys at a jaunty angle, but the star of the show here is the 1330s brass to Sir William Fitzralph, generally considered the most important brass in Essex, and one of the earliest martial brasses in England. I'm not a great one for brasses, but it is pretty awe-inspiring."

It is the largest Gothic cathedral and the third-largest church in the world. It was registered in 1987 by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, along with the Alczar palace complex and the General Archive of the Indies. The interior is vast and seems to extend in every direction with further aisles and chapels, and the scale makes it rather hard to take in. There are rich altarpieces, furnishings and stained glass windows everywhere, most in post-medieval styles (the glass is largely Renaissance whilst most of the altars are Baroque). The main exception to this rule is the awe-inspiring reredos behind the high altar, the retablos major, a wall of gilded sculpture rising almost the full height of the cathedral and adorned with scenes from the life of Christ, culminating in a dramatic coving and Crucifixion group at the apex. It is largely the lifetime work of Flemish artist Pierre  Dancart and dates from the late 15th century.  After its completion in the early 16th century, the Seville Cathedral supplanted Hagia Sophia as the largest cathedral in the world, a title the Byzantine church had held for nearly a thousand years. The cathedral is also the burial site of Christopher Columbus. "

Not everyone will find this attractive, but I actually find it all the more remarkable for it.  Copious quantities of stained glass is visible in the windows and weirdly shaped apertures, but alas I was out of luck as it was all locked up. There was a notice directing people wishing access to the church to the priest's house behind it, but I could tell my efforts were in vain as my appeal to look inside was met with a puzzled frown and a suggestion that I come back for mass the following morning. He was perhaps busy which is fair enough, but for me living nearly 20 miles away returning wasn't so simple.   I wasn't overly keen on looking around after a service, the timings didn't suit my trains and it would be likely busy, so when I saw 'confessions' listed 11-12 Saturday mornings thought that might be a better bet. Turned up to find the church was open but with a few people (inc. the priest I'd met before, who I didn't think would be overly keen to see me loitering again) sitting or kneeling quietly inside, I realised it was now exposition of the Blessed Sacrament instead. A very awkward time to look around, I'd have to content myself with quietly keeping out of the way in the chapels at the back and get some pics of their windows at least, but this wasn't enough for one member of the flock who noticed me and glared in a 'How dare you enter our church!' kind of way! I retreated out of sight into the baptistery to sit and look at a fine abstract window, but he decided to come and stand staring aggressively opposite me and clearly wanted to start something, but the atmosphere of awed silence prevented this and he left, but he'd made his point, I knew I was not welcome in this church.  I left shortly afterwards myself feeling frustrated (for the second time, not having been able to view or record the full interior) and deeply uncomfortable. I was hoping to bump meet my would-be assailant outside, having mentally prepared some suitable Biblical quotes about Christian behaviour since he displayed so little of it, but it was  most likely just an all too common case of being judged guilty of whatever before proven innocent.   So to summarise, this is one of the most remarkable modern church buildings I've seen, but from my experiences also just about the most unwelcoming I've ever visited. I'm sure, with hindsight, staying after a mass would have been a far better choice after all, reception might have been different (certainly couldn't be worse)."

They were discovered in 1961 by James Kieghlev, while performing an aerial survey of the region,  Some of the geoglyphs are as large as 300 ft/100 meters.  A later survey by geologist Robert Hamilton and engineer Emil de Bruyne resulted in the realization that the region was, at one point, populated by large agriculturally based culture with large settlements and ceremonial centers.  The largest of the geoglyphs is ""EL GIGANTE"" (the ""Giant""), which is almost 400 ft long (120 meters).   To date, on the hill-sides of Atacama, have been found representations of: humans, animals, and geometric designs.  The appears to use similar techniques to those found on the Nazca Plateau of Peru.  Unfortunately, access to these geoglyphs is restricted by lack of roads, making a walking trek necessary to view them. There are over 5,000 prehistoric geoglyphs in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile, and like the Nazca lines of Peru, they are mysterious, beautiful and awe-inspiring.  Although we can't know the entire reason they were built, researcher Luis Briones believes they are part sign post and part story-telling along a transportation network connecting the South American civilizations in combined commercial and religious travel led by caravans of llamas.     www.nazcamystery.com/atacama.htm"

I feel blessed when I see Sandhill Cranes, much less photograph them.  It lifts me up in the most amazing way, and I am ever in awe of their beauty, movements and interactions.  This is a photo of Cherry, taken by my estimation a week before she and Classic would start sitting the nest.  Classic does most of the sitting.  Hes a diligent dad and mate.  They are not nesting on the property where I work this year.  Weve had a lot more ducks nesting and hanging out in the ponds, including a Hooded Merganser family.  Lots of other birds are frequenting the property as well, Great Blue Heron, Great Egret, Snowy Egret, White Ibis, Little Blue and Lesser Blue Herons.  I got a decent photo of the Merganser family I will post. Spring is in full swing here in Central FL.  So many birds are nesting.  This morning as I was leaving for work, I startled what I think was pair of grackles that had come in our garage to grab some fuzzie/dust bunnies/spider-webby fluff for its nest. My hubby thinks they are trying to build a nest IN the garage.  As quaint as that is, its messy, so were keeping the garage door closed.  The Lakewood Osprey pair are nesting, but Ive seen no sign of a nest for the Rayas pair behind the Mexican restauarnt.  The owner of the restaurant told me he found one electrocuted.  Maybe it was one of the parents. Life is definitely hazardous for urban wildlife.  Im glad I have photos of them in all their glory, and Ill keep hoping Ill see them or their offspring in that area.                *Special Note: Dear Craniacs and Flickr Friends!  I am alive and kicking, and getting back to jumping out of my car with my camera, or running outside when I see or hear something.  Life and work are extra busy, and weve had some family stuff.  All is well, but I was stretched extra thin for a few months.  Thanks for Flickr Mailing me to make sure I was okay.  Im going to try to log some Flickr time at least once a week so people arent checking the obituaries for me.  Love and Hugs! =o) The Craniac ***All rights to my photos are strictly reserved.

Text Appearing Before Image: king gently in milky foam.Then returning, again to come;Constant never.Coqueting ever.Trimming with lace the curving shore,With silver fringing it oer and oer;Thus did the waves, one summer night.While we watched them play in the mellow light. The moon looked down on an opal sea,Which softly sang a lullaby;Born of the spirit of sad unrest.Flashing the diamonds on its breast. O, never a fairer sight was seenThan met our gaze that summer een;The long white reachOf the sandy beach,Bathed in a marvelous pearly light.Beckoned us on through the beauteous night;It seemed like a walk on the Heavenly shore,By the bou..dless sea of the Evermore. Twas a night to live in memory, Just the fairest picture there. To calm the troubled spirit. Like the breath of an angels prayer. A haze, like the rainbows shadow,Crept down the arched sky,Weaving with warp of moonlight A royal canopy.Whose folds were pinned with starlights,Whose beauty draped the sea,And all the realm of natureWas one grand harmony. 74  Text Appearing After Image: The moon looked down on an opal sea.On Massachusetts Coast POEMS FROM LIFES EXPERIENCE THE ANGELS SWEETEST SONG Twas at the hour of midnight, When earth in slumber lay,I dreamed of heavenly music Coming from far away;A melody far sweeter Than mortals ever heard,It drew me nearer, nearer. My very soul was stirred. Whence came this wondrous music? No being on this earthCould ever write its pages. Or ever give it birth;The harmony was perfect. It could not be surpassed,I listened, fondly hoping That it might always last. Then fled the dark of midnight, The heavens opened wide,I saw the angels singing, Before the Crucified,Ten thousand times ten thousand, Unnumbered was the throng.And like the Avaves of ocean The music rolled along. The stars no longer glittered And vanished one by one.Awed by the matchless glory That in the heavens shone;Triumphant was the music, Naught could resist it long,And I had heard in dreamland The angels sweetest song. 76 POEMS FROM LIFES EXPERIENCE A SongRlXGlx   Note About Images Please note that these images are extracted from scanned page images that may have been digitally enhanced for readability - coloration and appearance of these illustrations may not perfectly resemble the original work."

The canyon is narrow for 12 miles; the cliffs become steadily higher downstream, reaching a height of 500 feet above the streambed at the end, where Buckskin Gulch meets the Paria River which also flows through a deep canyon for several miles either side of the confluence.Location: Buckskin Gulch (named on some maps as Kaibab Gulch, or The Dive) is a tributary of the Paria River that drains an area around the Vermilion Cliffs in far south Utah and joins the Paria exactly at the Utah/Arizona border, 20 miles from Lees Ferry next to the Colorado River.

Although far beyond the peak season of May through early July, we decided to take a drive over after visiting Duke Farms (see our ALBUMS) during a late mid-August day.   We had been told about this lovely garden by a number of folks we had met over a week period earlier that month, and since the descriptions were consistently very appealingbased on peak season, in each casewe felt it would be worth the 6 or 7 miles from Duke Farms, for we had nothing to lose.  Basically, we just wanted to get an idea as to the general layout of the place for future consideration.  We were a bit skeptical in terms of expectations, having been spoiled by numerous visits to Longwood Gardens (see ALBUM for this site, too) in PAperhaps the greatest garden in North America with its over 1,000 acres of spectacular displays. Well, upon arriving later that day, we could instantly tell that this new garden would be special.  From the parking area, once notices the elegant layout of the enclosed rose garden, and even at this time of year, it was evident from a distance that many roses were still quite nice.  As we approached the gate, the roses still peaking were simply stunning.  Granted, not Longwood Gardens in scale, but with a focus on roses, it is definitely first class, and we could easily see the incredible passion administered by the gardeners and horticulturists.  Many of these roses were given official names, designated as unique species.  Most fell under the families of Grandiflora and Floribunda Roses, and for the most part, my wife was very diligent about notating the exact names and families.  I, on the other hand, was somewhat remiss in that several truly wonderful roses photographed toward the latter part of this visit were without detailed IDs.   Anyhow, we can only imagine what the scenery might be during the peak blooms, and we definitely intend to return to experience it.  For those residing in the New Jersey or Eastern PA regions, this is a MUST SEE place.  And if roses are amongst your favorite flowers, you will be in awe. "

It might have meant good tidings. It might have meant the opposite, depending on the culture. It's an awe inspiring sight, whatever era it happens in, though. And in this case, we were fortunate to stumble upon an unexpected display as we arrived to shoot Mount Hood and Trillium Lake here in Oregon. I'm starting to use more layers and masks in these types of shots, in this case curves and contrast masks on the sky and foreground. I'm not sure if there's a big difference in the final outcome compared with processing it as a single image through Lightroom and Photoshop, but I think it's at least a subtle improvement, even if the mask edges are a bit rough.  Thanks for viewing!"
