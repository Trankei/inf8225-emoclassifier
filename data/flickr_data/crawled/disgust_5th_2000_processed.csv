This time we joined forces with the beautiful, talented and passionate activists the Shoreditch Sisters to get as many people as possible to create beautiful vaginas to make people aware of the issue of Female Genital Cutting, 'designer vaginas' and the sigma and disgust people have for our natural organs.   we had about 30 people attend and lots of people really interested in this project. people sipped fair-trade tea and we had people of all crafty abilities embroidering beautiful vaginas (yep, you heard that right) whilst the Shoreditch Sisters explain how this is helping their campaign on Female Genital Mutilation.   we also discussed plans the Craftivist Collective want to do in 2010 to help make people aware of global poverty and injustices.  It was open to anyone who is passionate about making the world a better place and trying to help its potential by doing fun crafty activism (craft + activism = craftivism!)  All craft resources were provided but we also encouraged people to bring any fabric, thread, needles, scissors etc  This project is ongoing for the rest of 2010. We are hoping to make kits to post, give out at events and have at future meetings to people to add their embroidered vaginas to the Shoreditch Sisters collective. Hopefully they will be exhibited in London in February 2011"

It's bad enough you have to smoke those disgusting things, but then to litter on top of it, makes me think you are an arrogant, selfish, trashy, dirty, asshole. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU THROW THEM OUT YOUR CAR WINDOW. A cigarette filter can take up to fifteen years to decompose, and nicotine is very harmful to plants and wildlife. Litter is the worst, and just because a butt is small, doesn't mean the damage is. Don't be a jerk. If you have to smoke, put your butts in the proper receptacle. This week's theme is hatred. So I feel my rant is validated.  Also, the little sign there that says ""Please pick up the butts,"" isn't mine. I saw it on the ground next to the trash. But I find it ironic that a person reacted to litter with more litter. People are weird."

Two old losers pass on their delusion of power in an amazingly disgusting display of intellectual and emotional impotence.  www.youtube.com/watch?v=yf14VhDYvt0  A $42,000 camping trip. Two doddering old white men handing her multiple high powered rifles. All the while, a pounding symphony brings the excitement to a heady boiling point. The oldest of the old men craps his own pants and nearly shoots himself in the face, as Sarah shoots a totally motionless animal. Then she has the vile audacity to say a prayer over it about the meat going to a 'good family'. This displays everything disgusting about America. She didn't need the meat, she displayed no skill, no courage, and no intelligence. This footage needs to go in a time capsule in case the human race destroys itself through stupidity, ego, greed and self importance. It will go to explain a lot.   I vomited in my shoes and then put them on and walked a mile. Only to distract myself from the thought of Sarah Palin.  It was a pleasant stroll.  When she shuts up, I'll shut up.   Her defense for 'hunting' the caribou and rebuttal to her detractors was ""If you wear leather shoes or ever eat meat, you're a hypocrite."" Faulty logic as usual.   You are the hypocrite Pain (purposefully missing L) You say you shot the deer for the necessity of meat to eat, and yet you spent $42,000 on the trip and you are a millionaire. You have no need of self hunted meat. Also you are an embarrassment to real hunters (not that I have any love or respect for 'real' hunters, but you make them look even more like fools and incompetent bumblers.   Tell me how it's 'hunting' if you blast off your guns twice in a thunderous announcement across the wilderness of your incompetent presence, and the animal just stands there looking curious? It doesn't run away, it doesn't try and hide. How do you hunt something that doesn't try to elude you? That's like playing hide and seek with a retarded child who stands in plain sight when you give them time to hide. The creature had never heard a gun before. Never seen another human being most likely. You are the first example of our species it had the unfortunate opportunity to encounter. What a pity.  Ego: An Anti-Evolutionary Force-  Andrew Cohen What is ego? In an enlightenment context, the word ego refers to a deeply ingrained, unconscious, compulsive, and mechanical need to remain separate and superior at all times, in all places, under all circumstances. Ego is expressed as an irrational refusal to say yes to life, to love, and to Godto an unconditionally positive relationship to the human experience. The true face of ego is rarely seen for what it is except at those brief moments when you have recognized something as being absolutely positive, wholesome, and good, and are compelled to respond, to say a wholehearted yes to that which you have recognized. It is only in those moments that you come face to face with the force of a powerful inertia within you that blindly resists, defies, and denies that which is radically positive. This is what ego is: that immovable stance, deep in the human heart and mind, that irrationally resists any call from within or without to embrace the greatest goodness. When we aspire to evolve at the level of consciousness, to live a spiritual life, to become an enlightened person, we open our hearts to the thrilling possibility of something so inconceivably glorious that it's just too positive for most of us to bear. And it is only when we dare to even consider saying yes to this highest good that we will experience this kind of profound confrontation with our own selfboth with the anti-evolutionary force that exists in all of us, and with our normally untapped potential for extraordinary developmental leaps.

You will pay for what you've done.  www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOCGuL8obzs   this is going to be a very large rant, so prepare yourselves.   Last night, Sara, Rae, and I went to a Nickelback concert with the intent of seeing Papa Roach (one of my favorite bands) who was touring with them, Hinder, and Saving Abel.  We had pit passes.  Papa Roach was BEYOND AMAZING. as always. Jacoby is even more awesome up close. They played Had Enough off of their new album which is going to be a single but hasn't been released as one yet. But being obsessed fans, Sara and  I knew every word and sang along while everyone else just looked confused. Jerry, the guitarist, was staring at us in awe almost, for knowing the words. It was freaking awesome :D Jerry kept messing with the crowd. Gotta say (Sara) i respect him more now :)  But the most amazing thing happened just before they played Had Enough: Jacoby asked the entire crowd (16,500 people i believe) to take a moment of science to remember all who died on 9/11 (as it was the day after) and the entire place went dead silent. it was shocking, it was beautiful.   Now, on to the rant part of this. You see, Nickelback was never my favorite ever. They were always just 'eh alright' for me. Any of that little ounce of respect that was left for them, it is gone. First, Papa Roach's set was cut down to only 40 minutes so that Nickelback could have a grand 2 hour set. the stage set-up took an hour to put in place, complete with fire and taking up the entire stage while all the other bands had squeezed into the front.   Then, they come out in a flurry of screaming and sloshing beer. lovely. Throughout their very long set, Chad Kroeger (the lead singer of Nickelback) basically said how great it would be if you could legally get weed though a drive-thru, bragged about being a thief and smoking weed at age 13, advised a 10 year old boy in the pit he could do the same in a few years whilst his mother stood by smiling up at Chad,  shot beer at the crowd with a 'beer gun', and hazily remembered to sing a few poorly thought out songs. and the worst thing he did: even when it was the day after 9/11, even after Papa Roach and Saving Abel had both paid  tribute to our troops, Chad decides to joke about planes crashing.   Chad exercised his rock star powers, calling upon the stage crew left and right to get him a drink, then another, then (why the hell not) had a cart of 20 shots brought out. He then invited the Hinder lead singer and Jacoby the papa roach lead singer out for shots on stage. Jacoby is a recovering alcoholic and went through years of addiction and self hatred for those addictions. But oh no, Chad had to give him a shot. Jacoby tried refusing, even at one point saying he was going home to his sons 5th birthday. Chad practically called him an idiot, until finally Jacoby tipped it back and forced it down, then immediately walking off the stage.  In fact, Hinder and Saving Abel both had beer on stage and toased to the crowd. Papa Roach was the only one to drink only water.   I know personally that even if an alcoholic has been sober for a long time, they only need one drink to go back down. So who knows how Jacoby is now... thanks Chad.   Basically, this went on for a while longer. The slutty roadies were invited on stage to do some shots and Chad drunkenly cheered the fact that when you're a rock star, &quot;there's always lots of hot chicks everywhere.&quot; Well said Chad, well said. Very classy. We left the pit shortly after this, sickened, disgusted, and in shock.    Now, after ive got all that out, for the good part!! We decided to walk around, so set off. As we were going along, out of nowhere we see Tobin Esperance, the Papa Roach bass guitarist!! :D :D  After a short freak out session, we decided to take a chance, so i shoved Sara forward. They high-fived and we told Tobin how great they were, how much better than Nickelback.  He smiled, thanked us, and said he liked my shirt <3 It was so loud, we actually had to lean in an talk in his ear. We got a picture (yea he put his arm around me. *fangirl squeal*), said again how great they were, and Tobin promised they would be back for a headlining tour. yes yes yes!!! :D so that made the night okay.   very, very okay. <3   So, um yes i pretty much love anyone who actually read all of that.  also, read THIS  awesome article if you hate Nickelback. Actually, read THIS  article if you love Nickelback. Maybe it will open your eyes. "

If I see the eyes and the stripes on the head sure its a fascinating creature. But I dont need to see such a creature every day. For that photo I almost sat on his back. No work in photoshop. The insect is sitting in a bowl (glass), among the bowl is a blue paper and I do some experiments with the light. I am not 100% satisfied with the photo (f.e. focus) but the insect was not drilled and got the own way.    ______________________________  Insekten wrden eine Apokalypse vielleicht berleben.

When walking around the shore, a constant trail of rubbish exists right the way around the 2km walk.

Ditmars Blvd Astoria, NY 11105  This supermarket has been severely negligent in maintaining clean and safe garbage disposal practices on 43rd. Street between Ditmars Blvd. and 23rd. Ave. in Astoria Queens.  These photos were taken over a period of time that demonstrate their practice of substantially overfilling the small, few and broken garbage receptacles they have. The substantial overflow lands all over the sidewalk next to the entrance of residents homes. It then runs into the gutter and down the block. This turns 43rd. St. into an open sewer that attracts rats and all manner of bugs. The carting company does not clean this up. So this ""Garbage Stew"" remains for many hours putrefying on the street.  During the hot summer months the odor from this ""Garbage Stew"" is unbearable. The block always smells like garbage.There are apartments and resident windows right next to the garbage and loading dock area and private homes located across the street. The residents, which include elderly and families with children, should not have to accept this irresponsible and disgusting practice. As the residents have helped in prospering this supermarket with it's patronage, Berry Fresh Farm Inc. in kind, should have a responsibility to the community by adopting safe and sanitary garbage disposal practices."

Found in Tasmania and as far north as south-east Queensland, it has the distinction of being the first fungus from Australia to be scientifically described. It was named, no doubt after he smelled it, by botanist Jacques Labillardiere at Recherche Bay, Tasmania, in 1792.  The fungus appears to do a good job of mimicking a wound on an animal - an interesting piece of evolution, if true. It looks a bit like a fly trap, but it doesn't catch or eat flies. Instead, it uses them to spread its spores. For food it uses wood in the mulch or forest litter that it inhabits.  The fruiting body in the photo shows the smelly black spore slime that acts as a fly attractant. I find its odour more like that of rotting teeth than rotting flesh, a concentrated essence de caries.  The fruiting body only lasts a few days but rewards quiet observation. Our Aseroe specimens attract the rather beautiful, though agriculturally troublesome, green blowfly.  Kevin Maher, Witta, Queensland, Australia By Blogger Michael Marshall on October 29, 2008 4:36 PM Curiously, this fungus has leapt several continents and established itself in the UK on Oxshott Heath in Surrey, where it has been appearing exotically for the last 10 years or more.  The fungal fruiting body doesn't catch flies any more than a ripe apple catches wasps. The flies (which tend to be mainly bluebottles in the UK) are attracted to the carrion smell of the slimy spore mass supported on the tentacle-like arms. The slime contains sugars and the flies ingest it, spores and all. These pass through the gut unharmed and are dispersed elsewhere. The fungus itself - visible as a white mycelium - lives on rotten, often buried, wood.  A related Australian species with longer tentacles, Clathrus archeri or the devil's fingers, has also become established in southern England and is now quite widespread, as is the European Clathrus ruber, or cage fungus, whose tentacles mesh to form a cage-like receptacle.  More common and more familiar is our native stinkhorn, which also lures flies to help spread its spores. The stinkhorn forms fruiting bodies as obvious as the plant's Latin name, Phallus impudicus, suggests. It is said that Charles Darwin's daughter Etty used to rise early to destroy any that she found, in order to ensure that the morals of her maids were not corrupted.

Originally built in 1892 and rebuilt 1939, these Coal Miners helped build an Industry, create what should remain an unforgotten era in our history and basically helped build America....BUT, now added to the list of just 1 of many of Pennsylvania's most disgraceful mistakes and disrespectful atrocities towards the states history, as on April 25th 2014 in just a manner of seconds Demo crews created a pile of what they deemed as more valuable as scrap metal, than they value in Preserving History. As instead of trying to save such a monumental piece of not just PA's history but America's history and a symbol of what was once PA's most economic value and their main source in providing jobs in PA as the state was once the heart of building supplies, manufactured materials for all branches of the military and THIS....man powered/operated extracted earthly minerals that were necessary for the manufacturing of what fueled American Industry....the leading supplier of Coal and leading provider of manufactured Steel that forged the Industrial Revolution. At the time it was built the Ashley Huber Coal Breaker was the hugest most modern coal breaker IN THE WORLD capable of producing 1 thousand ton of coal per hour. The Huber Breaker Preservation Society who tried to save the Breaker and purchase it themselves was out bid in in the amount of $1.2 million in Bankruptcy court by Paselo Logistic LOCATED IN PHILADELPHIA a trucking company who's soul intention of purchasing the breaker WAS TO SELL THE STEEL FOR SCRAP. It is just heart breaking and disgusting to know that there is no moral value or intrinsic obligation in the world it seems in PRESERVING HISTORY unless money is made from doing so... and for the right price anything of any historical value or meaning can be sold. So when people ask or wonder or question why anyone or as it has been given the name ""Explorers"" take the risks involved whether legally or physically...to venture inside abandoned and forgotten places....the answer is an example of this...where as it unfortunately seems to so many and to most in our society today....that money holds more value and weight than the preservation and appreciation of history... There are those of us who cannot be bought and willingly and knowingly risk legal consequences as well as potential physical harm to ourselves for any opportunities we find to visually capture and share and hopefully convey an appreciation by others to recognize what SHOULD hold more ""weight and value"" and meaning to what we view in life.....for those of us who explored The Ashley Huber Breaker or even anyplace we find that has been forgotten by time there seems to become a spiritual connection or even an addiction like a 6th sense we have to feed...to satisfy our this internal appreciation that we can't help but feel...in the intrinsic value of history of places we find forgotten by time. We respect and admire how architecture of even places built 50 years ago were designed to be considered and often revered as a piece of art...and that buildings were created with not just the initial idea of what its ""structural functional purpose"" was going to be....but architects from past centuries, era's and even just decades ago designed structures from their heart with a creative passion and intentional desire for ""their art"" to be remembered, memorialized, appreciated and leave you with a sense of reverential respect. And once inside these places abandoned by time....we are fascinated and many times even dumbfounded by the things we find that are left behind and forgotten or buried by years that have past....left neglected....left to rust, decay and layers of grime and we want to visually preserve a now forgotten memory and share what should be... its intrinsic integrity, the once initial purpose and the now historical as well as architectural value and of what most either take for granted or seem to be too shallow minded and or creatively ignorant to see.... passed the broken windows, the rusting metal, and the peeling paint ....of something deemed inanimate and hope our photograph will give it a voice once again, and will breathe a life once forgotten, and capture a moment so it becomes more than just a memory....because soon...one day...it will meet the same fate as the Ashley Huber Breaker...and it is sad to think and just know....it will always be money as the motivation and the presiding as well as deciding factor that determines what is of Historical Value...the only thing in life that will ever remain priceless are our memories...."
