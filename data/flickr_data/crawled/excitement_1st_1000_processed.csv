It was a free afternoon for elementary-aged school children and their families to look at how NASA explores space and studies Earth from space using satellites and other technology.  This months Sunday Experiment explored NASAs Tracking and Data Relay Satellite project. The TDRS project at NASA Goddard is building three new Tracking and Data Relay Satellites: TDRS K, L and M. Nine TDRS spacecraft are currently in geosynchronous orbit. Together they form the space-based communication relay network known as the Space Network (SN).  The SN is made up of seven TDRS spacecraft that are responsible for relaying more than 40 different spacecrafts' data to the ground 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The TDRS constellation is responsible for gathering data from low-Earth orbiting spacecraft such as the Hubble Space Telescope, NASA's Earth-observing fleet of satellites and the International Space Station, and transmitting it to TDRS ground terminals. Once the data arrives at the ground terminals, it is sent out to the spacecrafts data processing facilities across the country. The communication also works the opposite direction with controllers on the ground using the SN to send commands like Hey, satellite, turn your camera on! to spacecraft.   TDRS K is the first of the third generation of TDRS satellites and is scheduled for launch in January 2013. This generation of TDRS will ensure that NASAs communication needs are met for many years to come.  In addition to celebrating all things science, technology, engineering and mathematics, the Sunday Experiment celebrates major science missions that are managed by NASA Goddard and set to launch in the near future. The Sunday Experiment is a place where children and adults alike can discover the excitement of Goddard through fun and engaging activities.  Sunday Experiment, held the third Sunday of each month, spotlights Goddard's world-renowned science and engineering research, and technological developments. Families leave inspired by the activities, wowed by the scientists and engineers, and excited about Goddard's revolutionary research and technology.

Barney has a thing about seaweed, he thinks it all needs to be pounced on, shaken and shredded! My dad, the dog and I have been away to the Gower Peninsular, south Wales for a long weekend (came back Monday, which is the day I took this)... We went camping which as usual Barney enjoyed - he especially enjoyed bouncing on my father's head at 6.00 in the morning and then bouncing on me too, shortly afterwards.   This usually got the dog thrown out of the tent and tethered up outside but his tactics of waking me worked as I was always out there with him 10 minutes later. There's something about being bounced on and licked in the face by a large, sandy dog that makes going back to sleep difficult! He spent most of our holiday at the beach, being crazy and excited (nothing new there then!) but I was pleased with how well he behaved around all the new dogs and people. He only gave me a heart attack once by jumping 10 ft off a rock, onto more rocks below. I think the excitement got to him and he couldn't be bothered to take the slow route down... Luckily, he avoided breaking anything. This is why I have him insured though - and pulling stunts like that is undoubtedly why his shoulders are a bit stiff these days. I think I might need to be more strict with my stupid stunt-dog - remind him he is NOT a cat! Oh well, no harm done this time - he just bounced and skipped off again to paddle in the sea :) More photos of our trip over on ipernity  Bit of a funny week for me... I was glad to get away at the start of the week but Fri 6th marked the 2 year anniversary of the operation to treat my cancer. Part of me can't believe it was so long and part of me feels like it was yesterday. I've said it before - but thank you to my friends here on Flickr who sent such kind messages - as soon as I was well enough, I read them all and it was a massive help, knowing I had so many rooting for my recovery. It is also 2 years since my granddad passed away - he died a couple of weeks before my op (I'm always glad because he never knew I was sick)... However, his funeral was a week after my operation. I was still much too ill to leave hospital (I was effectively in intensive care the first few days), so it is hard sometimes as I don't really feel I said goodbye properly. He was one of the kindest, most caring people I've met - and brave too, a fireman, earlier in life. He was also the one who got me interested in dogs and border collies - :) I miss him a lot, although I feel honoured to have known him. "

L'immagine non pu essere usata in nessun caso senza autorizzazione scritta dell'autore. Per contatti: mairo.cinquetti@gmail.com  From the opening squeals of the guitars of Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman and the punishing breakaway attack of Dave Lombardo's drums on ""Flesh Storm"" it's clear from the first thirty seconds the thrash metal titans have returned to pummel listeners with a raging onslaught of new music guaranteed to lay waste to MP3 players, car stereo speakers and whatever else gets in their way. Christ Illusion marks the long-awaited return of the legendary Slayer. Its first record in five years and its first record in fifteen years with the original band line-up, Christ Illusion is a cacophony of brutality. A soundtrack for the post-Apocalypse. Steeped in scorching riffs and a litany of menacing tracks/tirades on religion and violence, Slayer forges ahead on its devastating path of aural destruction with ten new songs, each charged with the electric hostility for which Slayer is renowned. Of the record Kerry King is ecstatic: ""I love it. I really like God Hates Us All and I think that's the best record we've done in my opinion since Seasons In The Abyss, and I like this better than that one. I think it's a more complete record, I think sonically it better: all the performances are awesome. I think this one is more intense not because we're trying to do 'Reign In Blood: The Sequel,' it's just that's where our writing is taking us now."" Songs like the ""Flesh Storm,"" ""Eyes of the Insane,"" ""Skeleton Christ,"" ""Jihad"" and the first single, ""Cult"" showcase the band at its most blazing intensity. The sonic excitement of speed, propelled by King, Hanneman and Lombardo and lead by the immutable roar of Tom Araya provoke the listener with Slayer's trademark fascination with terror, violence and religion. For as long as Slayer has been making records it has been surrounded by controversy. Since the band recorded its first album, ""Show No Mercy,"" Slayer has been plagued with accusations of Satanism, fascism, racism and so on. Christ Illusion gives no quarter to critics who would mindlessly attack the band for, what the Germans call, ""der Reiz des Unbekannten"" (meaning ""the attraction of the unknown""). A lyric fascination with violence and terror which guitarist King enthusiastically describes this way: ""When I was I kid I would see a horror movie over a love story. Being shocked, being in an environment that's not reality might be frightening but is cool nonetheless. With a lot of our songs we put people in that place. It doesn't bother me because I enjoy it. It could easily be programming from all the fucking news channels."" Slayer is often assailed for its subject matter, though the band is unrepentant. "" According to Araya, ""Violence, darkness... So much of my inspiration comes from news articles or pictures and just start describing the images. Television- A&E, the History Channel, Court TV, Documentaries."" The singer continues, ""With this record, as far as a theme: there is none. That's just our favorite subject matter. The common thread is death. I think that's just a common thread in general: we all share death, and we all share it at different times in different ways, but it's the one thing that we all have in common. We all die. It's how we live that makes us different."" Beyond being controversial Slayer is an exceptional force in music, highly praised for its trailblazing style of fast, heavy and aggressive music yet bristling with melody. The much-heralded return of Dave Lombardo to the drummer's throne will leave fans gasping for breath as he clobbers the listener on song after song. Commenting on Lombardo's return to the fold, King notes, ""Not to say the shine's worn off, but it's old news to us. I think the thing the kids are going to get into, besides just being the first Slayer album in five years, is that Dave's on it. When he came back he wasn't a member, he just came back to do a couple of tours and people started asking back then 'Is he gonna hang around?' And I would tell them that was up to Dave. But I could tell that Dave was having a killer time."" King confided. ""So it was just a matter of time before he said, 'Yeah, let's do it!' But it's great. And now that he's got a new Slayer album that he's played on, I think he's going to get some more enjoyment out of playing. He takes pride in everything he does and it's awesome to have him back with us."" Having the original members record their first album together in fifteen years is certainly newsworthy but the lasting might of the band and its continued popularity is an achievement few can boast. For each of the members, the band is resolute. There is no other band like Slayer. ""The staying power behind Slayer is that we've stuck to our guns,"" Says Araya. ""Integrity... that would be number one. A lot of it has to do with the fact that we've stuck to what we do best. And the fact that we've been together as a band for so long. Ten years with Dave; another ten without Dave; and now Dave's back. It has a lot to do with compromise, that's just the way it has to be. You have to be able to compromise and give and take and that has a lot to do with why we're still together and a force to be reckoned with. I've learned that without each other, Slayer wouldn't exist, and that the whole is greater than its parts."" Kerry King is far more succinct. ""Slayer to me is the coolest band on the planet. There is a timeless quality to Slayer. It's cool, but I can't explain it. It's our life."" Slayer has created one mesmerizing record after the next, has influenced many of today's most successful bands, including Slipknot, Sepultura, Killswitch Engage, and continues to earn new generations of fans, while staying true to its ceaselessly devoted followers. Slayer's legacy is cemented in music forever and the band remains undaunted in its directive to make punishing, aggressive and exciting music. With Christ Illusion the band marks its territory. Slayer has exceeded itself far beyond thrash metal to become an unstoppable juggernaut without equal. Tom Araya sums it up: ""I think the best thing is the band's longevity and the fact that we haven't bowed to anyone. That we were able to make a record like Reign In Blood, which, to us, was just another record, but to others, was something very special, it's had such an impact. People will remember it for a long time, and it's all because we did things our way, we didn't bow down to anyone. We didn't compromise. We stuck to being who we are."""

Landrake Moto Parc was founded in 1995 and is set in 25 acres of beautiful Cornish countryside, with the track taking approximately half of the site - the rest for paddock area and spectator parking. We also have another 10 acres for additional parking for the very large events. The track is 1900km long and is a minimum of 10 metres wide with some sections 15 metres wide and sits in a valley with trees on one side. With features such as a whoop section, raised berms, ski-ramps, step-downs and step-ups, and a laptime of over two minutes, exhilarating racing is ensured. 40 GP-standard start gates lead you to a 110 metre start straight, turning out into a wide downhill and then a chicane - followed by a very popular feature with spectators immediately in front of the pits - a table-top suitable for laying down some whips and scrubs, with a 100 foot tabletop right after! All this with superb viewing for specatators.   Whilst the track is fast and flowing, its a very technical track, with some old-school features such as adverse cambers and natural terrain, combined with some man-made jumps, along with a rythm section to add to the excitement for riders and spectators alike.

Despite snowy weather, families and friends arrived throughout the morning to enjoy an all-you-can-eat pancake breakfast with their loved ones.  There was a bake sale, operated by resident volunteers.  The variety of baked goods were sold and all monies went to the Resident Activities fund, to be used for special events and outings throughout the year.  There were also private vendors selling their wares, providing for some convenient holiday shopping.  Of course, the moment everyone was waiting for was the arrival of Santa. As the snow fell and the wind blew, some showed concern that Santa might not make it, but right on time, the doors opened and there stood Santa.  A wave of excitement and applause went through the crowd as Santa made his way to his chair next to the large Christmas tree.  ""Now this is my kinda weather!"" he shouted to the crowd as the children lined up.  Once the children finished telling Santa what they wanted, residents made their way to Santa's lap as well.  Staff and families soon followed suit as everyone wanted their picture with Santa.   Before Santa left, he drew a boy's name and a girl's name from the basket. Each child was given a FREE raffle ticket.  There were 2 giant baskets filled with toys and treats for the lucky boy and girl whose names were called. As the party came to a close, the winners were announced and the happy children collected their prizes.  There was also an adult raffle for a wine basket.  Tickets were $1.00 each and the money raised also went to the Resident Activity fund. ""I was worried that the weather would ruin the party."" Said Program Director, Angie Garbaczewski, ""Instead, it just created a beautiful back drop for it. We have our own White Christmas right here.""  "

For the nights feature, Mr. Cannibal has hand-picked the perversely comic RE-ANIMATOR, based on the classic tale by H.P. Lovecraft.

Cannibal, is a celebration of all things terrifying. The Improper Bostonian  Think Rocky Horror Picture Show with less androgyny and more anthropophagy.

All this with superb viewing for specatators.   Whilst the track is fast and flowing, its a very technical track, with some old-school features such as adverse cambers and natural terrain, combined with some man-made jumps, along with a rythm section to add to the excitement for riders and spectators alike.

It's been a couple of years since I last visited Yosemite, and after spending the last year based in Shanghai I was champing at the bit to get back out into one of my favourite locations on the West Coast of America.  I suppose the combination of excitement and jetlag were to blame for me getting very little sleep the night before (with the long drive to and from Lake Tahoe the day before not taking it's toll as I expected it to either).  After heading out the door of my hotel in Sunnyvale around 5am, I was entering the boundary of Yosemite around 9am, too late for sunrise but early enough to beat the main flock of tourists who would decend on the park in the hours which followed.  I was rather disappointed to learn that the Glacier Point road had been closed overnight due to recent snowfall, after it being opened for around a week before my visit.  My plan of shooting half dome and it's buddies with snow caps on from Glacier Point was scuppered, so instead I made the most of my time wandering around the meadows of the valley floor, enjoying the ever-awesome view from ""tunnel view"" and the majestic scenery surrounding Mirror Lake.  You can bet your bottom dollar that I'll be back to Yosemite as soon as I possibly can be to hopefully capture some snow caps from Glacier Point (and head up to Tenaya Lake) before the park fully embraces the summer months ahead."

While the temperature outside continued to rise, so did all the excitement. With the extremely hot weather, we changed our schedule to include more indoor activities. This helped both the campers and counselors stay as cool as possible. Of course, we added additional swim periods and encouraged lots of water breaks to help everyone beat the heat.  On Tuesday we had a surprise visit from the Glee Club who performed two fabulous songs. The Willows really had fun singing a repeat after me song with them. Uncle Teek, from security, also joined us for a delicious lunch the same day.  This weeks theme was Under the Sea. The Tadpoles and Minnows painted and decorated Goldfish Sun Catchers. In Ceramics, the campers enjoyed painting their clay hands and feet. All your childrens projects will be sent home shortly.   Picture day for The Willows was a huge success as the campers and staff had big smiles on their faces. Your copy will be sent home at the end of the summer.  The week ended with The Willows campers joining the main camp at Waterworld. They drove water boats, enjoyed climbing on the floats and sliding into a counselors arms. A terrific time was had by all!! Pictures of this wonderful event will be posted early next week.  We are looking forward to the next four weeks with. As a reminder, please remember to label all items brought to camp and wear yellow as often as possible.  About Willow Grove Day Camp Willow Grove Day Camp provides summer fun for kids who live in Willow Grove, Abington, Blue Bell, Hatboro, Horsham, Huntingdon Valley, Lafayette Hill, Philadelphia, Plymouth Meeting, Southampton and the surrounding areas.

Even the most diehard athletes and boosters would be hard-pressed, however, to match the intensity and staying power of the fund-raising efforts backing Holmes Desmelik and Amber Rhodes.  Visit Brevard High School any day of the week to observe ""Holmes Team"" and ""Amber's Angels"" fervently chasing their goals on behalf of these fellow students.  Both Amber and Holmes suffer from cancers which cannot be fully eradicated (if at all) through surgery.  In honor of both students, Blue Devils purchased headbands for a dollar apiece, then gathered on October 9th for a star-shaped photo to honor the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation.  In the end, that first wave raised over $1,200 for the teams (see our album).  Graphics teacher Katrina Ronneburger (BHS) said, ""I wanted to help my students come up with a way they could show support for Amber Rhodes - a senior from BHS - and Holmes - whose mother Clare teaches Spanish at BHS. Both of these families have a child that's been diagnosed with a brain tumor. We came up with 'Headbands 4 Hope,' and my students jumped all over it!   ""The campaign was run through my club (BHS Graphics Club) We sold almost 100 the 1st day without any promotion. My students made posters to put all over school - and it went crazy from there.  ""Several students made generous donations and only expected one headband, others bought $20 worth to pass out to friends. We did have several anonymous donations to raise our final total to $1200.00. We donated $600 to the Desmelik family and $600 to 'Make-A-Wish' for Amber's Team.""  Clare Desmelik added, ""Thanks for showing support for our families.  Holmes was diagnosed with a tumor in his thalamus, which most doctors consider inoperable.  Right now his tumor is stable and Holmes is enjoying kindergarten. He is a great little guy with a heart of gold.  One of his goals for this year is to make a green stamp for good behavior every single day at school and not to have to get a warning from his teachers.  ""There has been an incredible amount of love and support pouring in from the community.  Our friends and Holmes' friends, many churches and small businesses have all been so generous.  I am so blessed to work in such a wonderful school system.  The folks at TCS have overwhelmed us with support.  Faculty from all of the schools have reached out, as well as the good people at the Central Office.  BHS had our back from the very first day that our world changed with his diagnosis.  The faculty, the students and their families have boosted our spirits and helped in so many ways.  The staff at BES has made Holmes feel so welcomed and Holmes sure knows his way around the high school as well!  Students and staff alike make Holmes feel like the star he is!  ""The pie challenge on October 17th is something we called 'Whipping Childhood Cancer' in order to raise awareness and send love to Amber and the Rhodes Family, as well as raise money for Make a Wish, one of Amber's favorite charities.    ""Amber's brother Garrett challenged us with this earlier this year and we of course accepted and paid it forward to 7 others, helping to raise money for the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation.  We were ready for more pies and excitement...Holmes was especially looking forward to it!""  To follow up, a group of BHS teachers have organized  ""Rent-a- Student"" to help raise money for Holmes Team to cover mounting medical bills. The registration page is located at bit.ly/rent-a-student-2014.  Holmes also has a facebook page that many in our county are already following that keeps people up to date on how things are going and of events planned.  www.facebook.com/groups/holmesteam    Honestly, we have been humbled by the love, and he Holmes Team motto is ""Love Heals.""
