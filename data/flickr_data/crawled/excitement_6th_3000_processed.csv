We lined up side-by-side, many people thought we were with a newspaper or that we knew something really amazing was just about to take place and they asked what it was and wanted to watch too. I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over. I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol. I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.   Some of the photos might seem a bit strange with the movement/blur but I find them artistic and you can find some interesting pictures within a photo when you let yourself just look without expectations.

There was personal redemption, too, for Carli Lloyd, who answered her missed kick in that 3-1 shootout loss by scoring a goal in each half to seal the Olympic crown for her nation.  Japan were dubbed the Barcelona of the women's game for their flurry of neat passing and slick movement and their average height of 5ft 4in compared to the US's 5ft 7in. The Americans were the big tournament specialists. This was the fifth women's Olympic final and USA were continuing their record of being in all of them, losing only to Norway at Sydney 2000, 3-2.  For Japan, their coach Norio Sasaki framed the attempted conquest of gold as part of the country's healing process, following the trauma of last year's earthquake which killed nearly 20,000 people.  Ahead of this final he said: ""All the Japanese people are still trying to come back from the earthquake disaster.  ""Winning the World Cup was very emotional last year and gave energy to the nation after what had happened and the same can happen again.""  After eight minutes a noisy, though not completely filled Wembley, witnessed the opening strike. Tobin Heath galloped into space down the left before Alex Morgan's twist and cross was met by Carli Lloyd, just ahead of the 143-goal Abby Wambach.  Far from being unsettled, Japan went in search of an instant reply. A shot from Nahomi Kawasumi was blocked by the USA captain, Christie Rampone, with Hope Solo, the keeper, stranded. Yuki Ogimi followed up but could not convert.  Ogimi went closer moments later. A hanging jump was followed by the forward's header being superbly palmed onto the bar b y Solo.  The goal-frame proved an extra defender for both sides. Amy LePeilbet's cross was met with a glancing header by Rampone that hit Yuki Fukomoto's right post. At the opposite end, Aya Miyama's pile-driver smashed back off the bar.  Ogimi was instrumental in every Japan attack. Her lay-off nine minutes from half-time was hit with a menacing curl by Shinobu Ohno but the ball was marginally wide of the post.  The open, entertaining nature of this contest continued after the break. Japan spread the ball across midfield only for their attacks to founder due to a belief deficit. When given sight of goal  as Miyama, the captain, on 52 minutes  the opportunity was snatched at.  When America flooded forward there was menace. After Megan Rapinoe laid the ball into Lloyd, she surged from near half-way then unloaded a 20-yard humdinger that gave the 5ft 4in keeper Fukumoto no chance, and that was 2-0 to Pia Sunhage's team.  In the 63nd minute Japan's Ogimi raised the excitement scale to fevered after her strike, though this proved a consolation as the neat triangles that were ending in cul-de-sacs continued to frustrate the Japanese.  The world champions still had their chances but when Miyama had two free-kicks to deliver in quick succession, her side failed to profit."

Greetings and salutations to all our friends, We would like to apologize to those of you who have waited patiently for the ""surprise"" we promised for sending in your 1990 NEC survey.  At least your patience has been rewarded!  Enclosed you will find a rare ""TEST ISSUE"" of THE TICK.  This special 16-page trial version was prepared in response to feedback we got from our survey question regarding possible future formats for THE TICK.  So whadday think, hmmm?  This ""proto-TICK"" is being sent only to respondents to the NEC Survey.  While the total print run of this item is technically ""top secret"", we can tell you here that the number of existing copies is lower than virtually any other Tick comic book.  (I'm guessing less than 500 based on cgcforum) We shudder to think what the Price Guide value of the ""proto-Tick"" will someday be!  Mind-boggling, no doubt...   We hope this make you feel mighty special, and well you might--not only for your invaluable assistance and contribution to the NEC Survey, but also for your unswerving devotion to comicdom's favorite arachnid!  Also enclosed is the limited edition commemorative button, with which you may broadcast to the world that you, amonst few, survived the NEC 1990 Survey.  We hope that you can stand all of this excitement in one sitting!  So from all of us at NEC to all of you, we say thanks again and hope that we can continue to thrill and delight you in the months ahead.

It's been a couple of years since I last visited Yosemite, and after spending the last year based in Shanghai I was champing at the bit to get back out into one of my favourite locations on the West Coast of America.  I suppose the combination of excitement and jetlag were to blame for me getting very little sleep the night before (with the long drive to and from Lake Tahoe the day before not taking it's toll as I expected it to either).  After heading out the door of my hotel in Sunnyvale around 5am, I was entering the boundary of Yosemite around 9am, too late for sunrise but early enough to beat the main flock of tourists who would decend on the park in the hours which followed.  I was rather disappointed to learn that the Glacier Point road had been closed overnight due to recent snowfall, after it being opened for around a week before my visit.  My plan of shooting half dome and it's buddies with snow caps on from Glacier Point was scuppered, so instead I made the most of my time wandering around the meadows of the valley floor, enjoying the ever-awesome view from ""tunnel view"" and the majestic scenery surrounding Mirror Lake.  You can bet your bottom dollar that I'll be back to Yosemite as soon as I possibly can be to hopefully capture some snow caps from Glacier Point (and head up to Tenaya Lake) before the park fully embraces the summer months ahead."

I spent NYE on Granville St in Vancouver BC with two other fantastic photographers capturing the fun of the evening. We lined up side-by-side, many people thought we were with a newspaper or that we knew something really amazing was just about to take place and they asked what it was and wanted to watch too. I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over. I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol. I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.   Some of the photos might seem a bit strange with the movement/blur but I find them artistic and you can find some interesting pictures within a photo when you let yourself just look without expectations.

L'immagine non pu essere usata in nessun caso senza autorizzazione scritta dell'autore. Per contatti: mairo.cinquetti@gmail.com  From the opening squeals of the guitars of Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman and the punishing breakaway attack of Dave Lombardo's drums on ""Flesh Storm"" it's clear from the first thirty seconds the thrash metal titans have returned to pummel listeners with a raging onslaught of new music guaranteed to lay waste to MP3 players, car stereo speakers and whatever else gets in their way. Christ Illusion marks the long-awaited return of the legendary Slayer. Its first record in five years and its first record in fifteen years with the original band line-up, Christ Illusion is a cacophony of brutality. A soundtrack for the post-Apocalypse. Steeped in scorching riffs and a litany of menacing tracks/tirades on religion and violence, Slayer forges ahead on its devastating path of aural destruction with ten new songs, each charged with the electric hostility for which Slayer is renowned. Of the record Kerry King is ecstatic: ""I love it. I really like God Hates Us All and I think that's the best record we've done in my opinion since Seasons In The Abyss, and I like this better than that one. I think it's a more complete record, I think sonically it better: all the performances are awesome. I think this one is more intense not because we're trying to do 'Reign In Blood: The Sequel,' it's just that's where our writing is taking us now."" Songs like the ""Flesh Storm,"" ""Eyes of the Insane,"" ""Skeleton Christ,"" ""Jihad"" and the first single, ""Cult"" showcase the band at its most blazing intensity. The sonic excitement of speed, propelled by King, Hanneman and Lombardo and lead by the immutable roar of Tom Araya provoke the listener with Slayer's trademark fascination with terror, violence and religion. For as long as Slayer has been making records it has been surrounded by controversy. Since the band recorded its first album, ""Show No Mercy,"" Slayer has been plagued with accusations of Satanism, fascism, racism and so on. Christ Illusion gives no quarter to critics who would mindlessly attack the band for, what the Germans call, ""der Reiz des Unbekannten"" (meaning ""the attraction of the unknown""). A lyric fascination with violence and terror which guitarist King enthusiastically describes this way: ""When I was I kid I would see a horror movie over a love story. Being shocked, being in an environment that's not reality might be frightening but is cool nonetheless. With a lot of our songs we put people in that place. It doesn't bother me because I enjoy it. It could easily be programming from all the fucking news channels."" Slayer is often assailed for its subject matter, though the band is unrepentant. "" According to Araya, ""Violence, darkness... So much of my inspiration comes from news articles or pictures and just start describing the images. Television- A&E, the History Channel, Court TV, Documentaries."" The singer continues, ""With this record, as far as a theme: there is none. That's just our favorite subject matter. The common thread is death. I think that's just a common thread in general: we all share death, and we all share it at different times in different ways, but it's the one thing that we all have in common. We all die. It's how we live that makes us different."" Beyond being controversial Slayer is an exceptional force in music, highly praised for its trailblazing style of fast, heavy and aggressive music yet bristling with melody. The much-heralded return of Dave Lombardo to the drummer's throne will leave fans gasping for breath as he clobbers the listener on song after song. Commenting on Lombardo's return to the fold, King notes, ""Not to say the shine's worn off, but it's old news to us. I think the thing the kids are going to get into, besides just being the first Slayer album in five years, is that Dave's on it. When he came back he wasn't a member, he just came back to do a couple of tours and people started asking back then 'Is he gonna hang around?' And I would tell them that was up to Dave. But I could tell that Dave was having a killer time."" King confided. ""So it was just a matter of time before he said, 'Yeah, let's do it!' But it's great. And now that he's got a new Slayer album that he's played on, I think he's going to get some more enjoyment out of playing. He takes pride in everything he does and it's awesome to have him back with us."" Having the original members record their first album together in fifteen years is certainly newsworthy but the lasting might of the band and its continued popularity is an achievement few can boast. For each of the members, the band is resolute. There is no other band like Slayer. ""The staying power behind Slayer is that we've stuck to our guns,"" Says Araya. ""Integrity... that would be number one. A lot of it has to do with the fact that we've stuck to what we do best. And the fact that we've been together as a band for so long. Ten years with Dave; another ten without Dave; and now Dave's back. It has a lot to do with compromise, that's just the way it has to be. You have to be able to compromise and give and take and that has a lot to do with why we're still together and a force to be reckoned with. I've learned that without each other, Slayer wouldn't exist, and that the whole is greater than its parts."" Kerry King is far more succinct. ""Slayer to me is the coolest band on the planet. There is a timeless quality to Slayer. It's cool, but I can't explain it. It's our life."" Slayer has created one mesmerizing record after the next, has influenced many of today's most successful bands, including Slipknot, Sepultura, Killswitch Engage, and continues to earn new generations of fans, while staying true to its ceaselessly devoted followers. Slayer's legacy is cemented in music forever and the band remains undaunted in its directive to make punishing, aggressive and exciting music. With Christ Illusion the band marks its territory. Slayer has exceeded itself far beyond thrash metal to become an unstoppable juggernaut without equal. Tom Araya sums it up: ""I think the best thing is the band's longevity and the fact that we haven't bowed to anyone. That we were able to make a record like Reign In Blood, which, to us, was just another record, but to others, was something very special, it's had such an impact.

It was very exciting to have all of our Willows family members join us for our visiting day. We are so glad that so many parents and grandparents shared in the fun.  While the temperature outside continued to rise, so did all the excitement. With the extremely hot weather, we changed our schedule to include more indoor activities. This helped both the campers and counselors stay as cool as possible. Of course, we added additional swim periods and encouraged lots of water breaks to help everyone beat the heat.  On Tuesday we had a surprise visit from the Glee Club who performed two fabulous songs. The Willows really had fun singing a repeat after me song with them. Uncle Teek, from security, also joined us for a delicious lunch the same day.  This weeks theme was Under the Sea. The Tadpoles and Minnows painted and decorated Goldfish Sun Catchers. In Ceramics, the campers enjoyed painting their clay hands and feet. All your childrens projects will be sent home shortly.   Picture day for The Willows was a huge success as the campers and staff had big smiles on their faces. Your copy will be sent home at the end of the summer.  The week ended with The Willows campers joining the main camp at Waterworld. They drove water boats, enjoyed climbing on the floats and sliding into a counselors arms. A terrific time was had by all!! Pictures of this wonderful event will be posted early next week.  We are looking forward to the next four weeks with. As a reminder, please remember to label all items brought to camp and wear yellow as often as possible.

""Two years ago I was so scared to meet you I considered vomiting on the sidewalk outside the bar and walking home, standing you up.  In these two years since, weve visited Harry Potter and made fun of Orlando together (expacto refundo!), we went to the oldest restaurant in New Orleans and saw a waiter light his sleeve on fire, we have played in tide pools at the coast, I dragged you over a log jam into a gorge to swim in a waterfall against your better judgement, we partied it up speedo style in San Diego, we have heard the roar of monster trucks, we celebrated your birthday with champagne and a helicopter flight over Las Vegas, weve seen the ocean floor in a submarine off the coast of a tropical island in the East China Sea, weve eaten horse and crazy fried things, we soared over the Seoul skyline in a gondola, we swam in a cave full of bats and tropical birds, climbed to the top of the largest temple on the Mayan Peninsula, weve raised chickens and managed to fit three dogs and three cats into one home.  Its been crazy, its been hilarious, its been romantic and passionate and uniquely us, and hard to believe how much weve crammed into 24 months  I can only imagine what comes next. I cant think of anyone else Id want by my side as we medicate sick chickens, redo floors, travel, bowl, share ice cream cakes, and live #shitmyboyfriendsays every day, even the truly offensive things I dont share with the public.  Happy anniversary to my favorite boy ever.   Yesterday I went downstairs to check on our newest baby chickens. I tiptoed down the stairs, and said, Good morning, peepers! and I pulled the lamp off their box. I looked in, and the first thing I saw wasnt the peepers, it was a box.  A small velvet ring box.  I stared at it, dumbfounded. I actually looked around the basement, wondering where it came from, and how it could have accidentally gotten in the chicken box. I put the lamp back on the box, and looked around the basement again. I picked up a clean towel, grabbed some clean clothes, and lifted the lamp again. I stared in at the baby peepers, and picked up the box. I put the lamp back. I held the towel and clothes under one arm, and I opened the box, truly puzzled, still with sleep in my eyes, and stared at a vintage diamond ring set. A center stone, set in a unique swirl, with a band of diamonds arcing around it.  I snapped the box shut and looked back in on the chickens, like a moron. I made my way back up the basement steps. I walked into the bedroom, where he was still asleep. I plopped on the bed, box in hand. He opened an eye and started giggling. I knew you couldnt resist saying hi to the baby peepers. I held up the box, still sorta confused, and wanting to be excited, but not entirely sure if I had the right idea.  Baby, will you get Mickey Avalon to play our wedding reception? I pounced on him, kissing him, and telling him yes a hundred times and that if he asked me a hundred times I would still say yes. At 7:30 am, the chickens had proposed to me. And him, too. He told me happy anniversary, at this point I was shaking and squealing, and he was laughing at me. He told me all his crazy ideas about how he was going to do it, and how hed finally settled on the babies, knowing Id find the box first thing. I didnt want to leave for work I was so excited. But I made it through the day, with hundreds of texts and well-wishes pouring in from around the country, as news of our engagement broke.  Im excited to plan our wedding, to include people important to us, to make us official. But Im also looking forward to the next year of getting to call him my fiance and telling people the story of my confusion of the ring box under the chick lamp. And I am so incredibly lucky to look forward to a lifetime with this man. I cant imagine having met a better match.  The ring is a family piece, and I'm wearing it without the band until the wedding, obviously. Like a dork I spent the better part of yesterday staring at the ring, and last night I woke up multiple times due to the excitement. I can't believe I almost stood this guy up.  "

Cannibaldubbed the King of Horror Burlesquereturns one more time to present THE THIRTEENTH AND FINAL CHAPTER in his gruesome banquet of midnight mayhem!   After 7 long years of silence local cult band Reverend Glasseye returns as a shaken and somber beast to kick off this frightful night of fun! Emerging in the 90s as one of the originators of the East coast's dark cabaret movement, the band solidified its place on the scene with its junk aesthetic and operatic bravadocombining American and East European folk music to eventually win Boston's Rock and Roll Rumble in 2005. Now Reverend Glasseye finally slouches again toward Bostonand with a return to its folk roots, the band has created a sound that is leaner and darker than ever! Following their set will be a bevy of grotesque burlesque courtesy of the infamous horror troupe, Black Cat Burlesque. Dedicated to putting the BUMP back into the night, Black Cat Burlesque has been raising pulses, the dead and a whole lot of hell since 2003. As the bad seeds of Boston Burlesque, this scream team mines the depths of their twisted psychesblending striptease thrills and spookshow chills to push the boundaries of the art form and explore the dark, cobwebbed corners of neo-cabaret.  For the nights feature, Mr. Cannibal has hand-picked Peter Jackson's perversely comic BAD TASTE, screening on 35 mm film! Driven by a wild combination of extreme gore, horror, and comedy: this seminal cult classic is an often forgotten classic from one of the world's most popular contemporary film makers. You definitely want to catch this one on the big screen!  Free gory goodie bags will be handed out to all, and J. Cannibal will award a number of prizes for the best zombie costumes.  Brought to you by the creative minds of Black Ocean, this will be a show of insanity from beyond the grave that you dont want to miss! With hundreds of fiends showing up to each Feast of Flesh over the past ten years, come see what the excitement is about for yourself!  A thick slab of praise for J. Cannibal and his Feast of Flesh: J. Cannibal, the King of Horror Burlesque. Boston's Weekly Dig J. Cannibal's Feast of Flesh, led by real-life undertaker and zombie lover J. Cannibal, is a celebration of all things terrifying. The Improper Bostonian Think Rocky Horror Picture Show with less androgyny and more anthropophagy.

For this picture I did a but more editing than I normally do to try and make give it a pop art and retro feel. I first used the rotate option to make it a bit more interesting than all the straight pictures i may have in my portfolio. I then used an color effect to make the picture seem retro and also used vibrance so it would not seem washed up by the new color scheme. I decided to take this picture because again it seems like a nice art piece will go unnoticed to all the excitement of plunging into the pool.

The streets were lined with people, and hundreds took photos, cheered and waved as the torch traveled past. Lit in Greece, the Olympic Flame arrived in the UK on 18 May 2012 before setting out the next day on a 70-day Olympic Torch Relay, bringing the excitement of the Games to everyone.    The Olympic Flame stands for peace, unity and friendship. It is being carried by 8,000 truly inspirational Torchbearers.  A very precise ritual for the lighting of the Flame is followed at every Games. It is lit from the sun's rays at the Temple of Hera in Olympia, in a traditional ceremony among the ruins of the home of the Ancient Games.    After a short relay around Greece, the Flame is handed over to the new Host City at another ceremony in the Panathenaiko stadium in Athens.    The Flame is then delivered to the Host Country, where it is transferred from one Torchbearer to another, spreading the message of peace, unity and friendship.   It ends its journey as the last Torchbearer lights the Cauldron at the Opening Ceremony in the Olympic Stadium, marking the official start of the Games. The Flame then stays lit until it is put out at the Closing Ceremony, signifying the end of the Games.  I was so impressed with how excited everyone was, and how good the police were with whistles and horns to jolly along the waiting crowds. I loved seeing it, as did my kids."

I took the NFL ""Behind the Scenes"" tour of Lucas Oil Stadium, home of the Indianapolis Colts and of Super Bowl XLVI, on Monday evening.  I was expecting the place to be a bit of a mess less than 24 hours after the Super Bowl, and I wasn't disappointed.  But I was also impressed by how much clean-up and tear-down had already been accomplished.  In fact, I was little dismayed by how much of the Super Bowl signage and decoration had already been torn down -- I was hoping they would leave most of that in place for the last two days of the stadium tours.  This is the view from the Quarterback Suite.  If you don't have a private suite but don't want to sit in the stands, the Quarterback Suite is a 200-seat public suite with an amazing view -- this amazing view!  Our tour guide couldn't give us ticket prices, but one of the staffers saw a QB Suite ticket on Sunday with a face value of $1700.    The confetti is still piled along the sidelines, the field is still painted for the Super Bowl, and the crew was working to tear down all of the special lighting and sound rigging from Madonna's halftime show.  It's been a crazy couple of weeks here in Indy, but it's been a lot of fun, even for someone like me who really doesn't care about football.  The Super Bowl committee, the army of volunteers, the police, and everyone who worked so hard on Super Bowl XLVI did an amazing job!  The city was festive, clean, and safe.  I love this town -- Yay Indy!  This started out as week 5 of my Project 52, but upon further review, I had to change my mind and make this my runner-up instead..."

In honor of both students, Blue Devils purchased headbands for a dollar apiece, then gathered on October 9th for a star-shaped photo to honor the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation.  In the end, that first wave raised over $1,200 for the teams (see our album).  Graphics teacher Katrina Ronneburger (BHS) said, ""I wanted to help my students come up with a way they could show support for Amber Rhodes - a senior from BHS - and Holmes - whose mother Clare teaches Spanish at BHS. Both of these families have a child that's been diagnosed with a brain tumor. We came up with 'Headbands 4 Hope,' and my students jumped all over it!   ""The campaign was run through my club (BHS Graphics Club) We sold almost 100 the 1st day without any promotion. My students made posters to put all over school - and it went crazy from there.  ""Several students made generous donations and only expected one headband, others bought $20 worth to pass out to friends. We did have several anonymous donations to raise our final total to $1200.00. We donated $600 to the Desmelik family and $600 to 'Make-A-Wish' for Amber's Team.""  Clare Desmelik added, ""Thanks for showing support for our families.  Holmes was diagnosed with a tumor in his thalamus, which most doctors consider inoperable.  Right now his tumor is stable and Holmes is enjoying kindergarten. He is a great little guy with a heart of gold.  One of his goals for this year is to make a green stamp for good behavior every single day at school and not to have to get a warning from his teachers.  ""There has been an incredible amount of love and support pouring in from the community.  Our friends and Holmes' friends, many churches and small businesses have all been so generous.  I am so blessed to work in such a wonderful school system.  The folks at TCS have overwhelmed us with support.  Faculty from all of the schools have reached out, as well as the good people at the Central Office.  BHS had our back from the very first day that our world changed with his diagnosis.  The faculty, the students and their families have boosted our spirits and helped in so many ways.  The staff at BES has made Holmes feel so welcomed and Holmes sure knows his way around the high school as well!  Students and staff alike make Holmes feel like the star he is!  ""The pie challenge on October 17th is something we called 'Whipping Childhood Cancer' in order to raise awareness and send love to Amber and the Rhodes Family, as well as raise money for Make a Wish, one of Amber's favorite charities.    ""Amber's brother Garrett challenged us with this earlier this year and we of course accepted and paid it forward to 7 others, helping to raise money for the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation.  We were ready for more pies and excitement...Holmes was especially looking forward to it!""  To follow up, a group of BHS teachers have organized  ""Rent-a- Student"" to help raise money for Holmes Team to cover mounting medical bills. The registration page is located at bit.ly/rent-a-student-2014.  Holmes also has a facebook page that many in our county are already following that keeps people up to date on how things are going and of events planned.  www.facebook.com/groups/holmesteam    Honestly, we have been humbled by the love, and he Holmes Team motto is ""Love Heals.""

I spent NYE on Granville St in Vancouver BC with two other fantastic photographers capturing the fun of the evening. We lined up side-by-side, many people thought we were with a newspaper or that we knew something really amazing was just about to take place and they asked what it was and wanted to watch too. I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over. I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol. I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.   Some of the photos might seem a bit strange with the movement/blur but I find them artistic and you can find some interesting pictures within a photo when you let yourself just look without expectations. You may also notice the odd clear face/s that paused in all the movement & excitement. All in all, everyone was having a fantastic time!!  If you see yourself in any of the pictures on my Facebook page, please tag yourself and then share the photos to your friends & family. If you like my page then you will get notified for when I post the rest of the pictures which are coming soon! www.facebook.com/AnnaHallPhotographer  Thank YOU for posing for me and bringing such great energy to NYE!!"

It was very exciting to have all of our Willows family members join us for our visiting day. We hope you had as much fun as we did.  While the temperature outside continued to rise, so did the fun and excitement. All the children had plenty of water breaks and extra time swimming to keep cool. Even the threat of rain didnt dampen our spirits. We had the opportunity to have an extra special snack of sandwich cookies decorated with icing and jimmies.  This weeks theme was Finding Nemo, and the Tadpoles and Minnows created CD fish door hangers in Camper Creations. At Ceramics, the campers enjoyed painting their clay hands and feet. All your childrens projects will be sent home shortly. On Wednesday, in preparation for Waterworld and to honor our weekly theme of Finding Nemo, many of our Tadpoles and Minnows attempted the giant water slide and loved it.  To end our wonderful week, The Willows campers joined the rest of camp at Waterworld. The children drove water boats and joined in other great water activities. A terrific time was had by all!  We are looking forward to the next four weeks with your children. As a reminder, please remember to label all items brought to camp and wear yellow as much as possible.

In this superlative mystery comedy statuettes of little soldier boys on the mantel of a house on an island off the coast of Devon fall to the floor and break one by one as those in the house succumb to a diabolical avenger. A nursery rhyme tells how each of the ten soldiers met his death until there were none. Eight guests who have never met each other on their apparently absent host and hostess are lured to the island, along with the two house servants, marooned.   A mysterious voice accuses each of having gotten away with murder and then one drops dead  poisoned. One down and nine to go! The excitement never lets up and the search for the murderer never ceases which keeps the audience at the edge of their seat.

Landrake Moto Parc was founded in 1995 and is set in 25 acres of beautiful Cornish countryside, with the track taking approximately half of the site - the rest for paddock area and spectator parking. We also have another 10 acres for additional parking for the very large events. The track is 1900km long and is a minimum of 10 metres wide with some sections 15 metres wide and sits in a valley with trees on one side. With features such as a whoop section, raised berms, ski-ramps, step-downs and step-ups, and a laptime of over two minutes, exhilarating racing is ensured. 40 GP-standard start gates lead you to a 110 metre start straight, turning out into a wide downhill and then a chicane - followed by a very popular feature with spectators immediately in front of the pits - a table-top suitable for laying down some whips and scrubs, with a 100 foot tabletop right after! All this with superb viewing for specatators.   Whilst the track is fast and flowing, its a very technical track, with some old-school features such as adverse cambers and natural terrain, combined with some man-made jumps, along with a rythm section to add to the excitement for riders and spectators alike.

It can save you time by spending 1 day cooking enough meals using this meat which will last all week.  It is a great idea to continually file your personal taxes while they are due.

It can save you a great amount of cash if you remain patient. The excitement of brand new technology convinces many people to purchase electronics every time they are released.

After 7 long years of silence local cult band Reverend Glasseye returns as a shaken and somber beast to kick off this frightful night of fun! Emerging in the 90s as one of the originators of the East coast's dark cabaret movement, the band solidified its place on the scene with its junk aesthetic and operatic bravadocombining American and East European folk music to eventually win Boston's Rock and Roll Rumble in 2005. Now Reverend Glasseye finally slouches again toward Bostonand with a return to its folk roots, the band has created a sound that is leaner and darker than ever! Following their set will be a bevy of grotesque burlesque courtesy of the infamous horror troupe, Black Cat Burlesque. Dedicated to putting the BUMP back into the night, Black Cat Burlesque has been raising pulses, the dead and a whole lot of hell since 2003.

You definitely want to catch this one on the big screen!  Free gory goodie bags will be handed out to all, and J. Cannibal will award a number of prizes for the best zombie costumes.  Brought to you by the creative minds of Black Ocean, this will be a show of insanity from beyond the grave that you dont want to miss!

Cannibal, is a celebration of all things terrifying. The Improper Bostonian Think Rocky Horror Picture Show with less androgyny and more anthropophagy.

I spent NYE on Granville St in Vancouver BC with two other fantastic photographers capturing the fun of the evening. We lined up side-by-side, many people thought we were with a newspaper or that we knew something really amazing was just about to take place and they asked what it was and wanted to watch too. I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over. I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol. I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.   Some of the photos might seem a bit strange with the movement/blur but I find them artistic and you can find some interesting pictures within a photo when you let yourself just look without expectations. You may also notice the odd clear face/s that paused in all the movement & excitement. All in all, everyone was having a fantastic time!!

The general rule is, the more popular, the more expensive, the more busy and the more guides. I was not sure we were in the right spot when we pulled into a driveway and were greeted with excitement from all directions. Kids and adults were running to the car from various side streets and no tourist cars were to be seen. Everyone was out to show us where to go. It seems like they do not get too much traffic and were excited to see someone.   The road towards the hiking trail was ugly. Luckily we were in a 4wd Jimmy (like a small landcruiser), as a normal minibus would not have made it. A group of eight local kids escorted us to the falls through their family coffee plantation. There were coffee plants with berries the whole way. We sampled the ripe fruit. It was a bit sweet, almost flavorless and nothing like coffee. Inside was the green coffee bean. This is what we imagined our land was going to look like.   This trip was fun and was making up for the rest of the day. The kids were playing with Laurent and carrying her to the falls with a piggyback ride. The falls were not bad. They were high, but the flow was low. The lighting was still strongly contrasted with no clouds and strong shadows from the trees, even though it was almost sunset. We had the place to ourselves, with the exception of the local kids. Then Chintya called me over to tell me something and some of the fun was lost. One of the girls had been talking to Chintya. She told us that they were our guides and we should pay them $5 on top of the $1 entrance fee. Also, the girl playing with Laurent was baby sitting her and that we should pay her an extra $2. She would go around whispering things to the other kids. This ruined the experience. The other seven kids were nice, but the older one was charging us for everything. So, if you go to Blahmantung, either ditch the kids or bring extra money. Park at the top, go down the road to the concrete ramp, up the ramp, and follow the unmistakeable trail to the falls.  On the way out the Jimmy got stalled going up a hill. After rolling backwards down to a more level spot it still did not have the torque to climb out with all of us. Everybody emptied out, while me and Chintya helped push. Once on more level ground we all piled in and went back home.   Rant time:  Chintya's told her friend that I am taking pictures and writing about our experiences on this trip. She does not want me listing local prices for anything. She is afraid I am going to kill businesses. She gets a commission for finding clients for her employer's villa, so she tries to get $350/night. She like many others here think that everyone from a developed country is a millionaire. She doesn't understand that most people can't afford to cross an ocean or how long it takes to get here. There seems to be no comprehension of how the rest of the world lives. At that price how many people can afford to stay for more than 3 days? Maybe it is not too bad for a three day weekend from Australia or Japan, but to come from Canada, USA or Europe takes 20+ hours. Why limit your business to only the closest countries and not the rest of the world? Wouldn't it be better to get them for a week or two and slowly bleed them out. I read something the other day that hotel occupancy was around 50% and the average stay was less than 3 days. They are losing tourists to Thailand, because people think it is too expensive here. Fried rice with and egg is less than $1, one street over you will pay $3-5. I am starting to think that Bali's real estate bubble is getting ready to burst. Chintya's other friend just sold off all of her rentals, because she could not get occupancy. I still have seen many hotels and villas under construction everywhere we have been. I think we are going to try to sell our land too since there are no coffee plants. The farmer is still asking for his $50. I can put the money towards my brewery. When we told people are budget for rent, those in the business told us we would not get something for less than $500/month. Yet, most locals live on less than $500/month.    The mentality here is odd. The same person that survives on tourism refuses to use a garbage can. Chintya asked her before not to throw trash from the car so that Laurent will not do the same. She did not understand why. Yesterday at the falls, she put some trash on the ground and Chintya put it in the car. When Chintya wasn't looking she put it back on the ground. How could you not understand that if you want people to come see your nature, they don't want to see piles of trash. Chintya tried to explain how long it takes to degrade, she did not understand. Last time we came, we stayed at a different friend's house. When we asked what to do with the trash, they said to just throw it over the fence to the neighbor's land. I have seen Chintya's family do the same on fishing trips. When done with something, just toss it in the ocean, cigarette boxes, water bottles, candy wrappers...     "

The Big Lunch was a simple but clever way to bring all the generations together. The children and elderly residents got to know each other better, sharing local stories and songs, and discovering the wealth of talent on our doorstep. It all helped to create a feel good atmosphere on our street. It has had a profoundly positive effect on the whole street, and we not only know who our neighbours are, but have since supported each other in times of loss.  After our second party in September we started a befriending scheme were we look out for our each others houses and elderly neighbours, and are alerted to a problem if their curtains are not open by lunchtime. A simple task which works! For this year Big Lunch', we made our own bunting, banners, and collected donations. The excitement in the run up to the party is almost as good as the day its self on our street. We are all proud to live in Portstewart and our Big Lunch celebrates the good will on our street. I would encourage anyone to give it a go as The Big Lunch team are there to help you and it doesnt need to cost much if everyone brings something to the table. Sure its fantastic fun and can make a difference in so many ways. A special thanks to. ASDA for providing their support and food, and McGee butchers for providing burgers and sausages.

After 7 long years of silence local cult band Reverend Glasseye returns as a shaken and somber beast to kick off this frightful night of fun! Emerging in the 90s as one of the originators of the East coast's dark cabaret movement, the band solidified its place on the scene with its junk aesthetic and operatic bravadocombining American and East European folk music to eventually win Boston's Rock and Roll Rumble in 2005.

The event featured activities geared toward health including, Wheelchair Basketball, a fitness boot camp, Zumba, Tennis, and cardio-weight exercises.  Wow! Wonderful! Awesome! Impressive! Those were just a few of the words used to describe Missouri City's new Recreation and Tennis Center at the facility's Grand Opening Ribbon-Cutting ceremony held on Saturday, July 14.  The crowd on hand had plenty to do! There were dozens of activities and guests:  *Enjoyed tours of the center conducted by Staff and Parks' Board Members *Watched athletes compete in Wheelchair Basketball and a karate competition *Listened to a live radio show hosted by SportsTalk 790 AM *Played games and won prizes at an old-fashioned Fair hosted by the ARC of Fort Bend County *Purchased tasty home-grown items at a Farmers Market *Sweated through a boot camp workout that challenged the most dedicated exercise enthusiast *Tested their baseball skills in the facility's four batting cages and their backhand shots on the center's 13 beautiful tennis courts *Relaxed at a soothing Yoga class *Had identifications made for their children by the Police Department *Played with twisted-balloon toys made by a balloon artist  And, in perhaps the highlight of the day, encouraged the players in a Tennis Doubles Match featuring Mayor Pro Tem Jerry Wyatt and Assistant City Manager Bill Atkinson against Stafford Mayor Leonard Scarcella and Tennis Committee Member Don Cooper. After the teams volleyed back-and-forth in humid conditions, Missouri City emerged victorious, winning 6-2.  The 24,488-square-foot facility has many amenities designed for all ages and the parking area has been doubled in size. In addition to the tennis courts and batting cages, the center has a full-size gymnasium complete with electronic scoreboards for basketball and volleyball buffs, two multipurpose rooms for community meetings and special events, a 3,300-square-foot cardio-weight room with state-of-the-art exercise equipment, a dance studio for yoga, boot camp, and spin, cheerleading, tumbling, karate and Zumba classes, and a Kid Zone. In addition, the building has an energy-efficient outdoor lighting system, new landscaping with several mature trees and a new storm sewer system and utilities.  ""We're hoping to help revitalize the community and work with our neighbors to make a positive influence in this area,"" said Parks & Recreation Director Larry Foos, who thanked everyone who helped make the vision of the new facility a reality.  Residents and visitors weren't the only ones impressed with the new $4.5 million amenity built by Rosenberger Construction, LP. Many dignitaries also helped celebrate the grand opening, including cutting a ceremonial red ribbon. ""It's my job to lead the cheer today,"" said Congressman Al Green. ""This is a great place for young people to have an opportunity to do something that's wholesome and healthy and that will get them active."" Green also presented City Council with a certificate of special recognition and a flag that had flown over the U.S. Capitol in honor of the day's big event.  Which picture did Barbara choose for the ribbon cutting?  Tennis aces, from left: Bill Atkinson, Jerry Wyatt, Leonard Scarcella and Don Cooper.  Mayor Allen Owen pointed out the importance of the facility to the entire City, and especially the area surrounding it. ""This will revitalize the Texas Parkway/Cartwright Road Corridor and the new center is a major part of our overall initiatives for growth and development,"" he said. He also spoke about the path leading up to the opening, which included: the shuttering of the former tennis facility at the site in 2007, the vote by City Council to authorize an independent appraisal of the facility in May 2008, the successful offer by the City to the bankruptcy court of a ""little over $1 million"" to buy the facility, and the simultaneously approved $950,000 matching grant from Texas Parks & Wildlife Department, with the help of State Sen. Joan Huffman and State Rep. Charlie Howard. The grant was one of only two approved statewide that year. After the property was purchased, City Staff hosted public meetings to seek input from residents before building the facility.  Mayor Pro Tem Wyatt pointed out that ""we wanted something for everyone and this is another piece of that, which will also include the City Centre at Quail Valley"" that will be completed later this summer. Wyatt said almost 80 percent of the residents who approved the $17.5 million dollar bond referendum for parks improvements in 2008 are now seeing their vision realized with construction of both new facilities.  And, he hinted at more tennis challenges to come. ""We agreed to have a traveling trophy and hold a rematch with Mayor Scarcella,"" he proclaimed.  Council Member Don Smith, whose District B includes the new center, spoke about its significance to the area. ""When it was decided that we would bring this center to fruition, and determined it would be in this district, I was really proud,"" he noted.  Council Member Danny Nguyen added that ""the center is not only about a beautiful facility with nice equipment inside"" but also the people who will enjoy it. ""Actions speak louder than words and your actions today speak loudly and clearly,"" he said.  Echoing those sentiments, Council Member Floyd Emery spoke about the opportunity of having a multifaceted venue for all ages ""from four to 80"" to the ""Show Me City"" and urged residents to sign up for memberships.  Council Member Robin Elackatt offered special thanks to the City's Parks Board, who ""have done a great amount of work planning and working on this project.""  Parks Board Chairman Llarance Turner expressed his excitement in one word-""Wow!""  And residents exclaimed the same high praise. Mary Lou Cooper said, ""It's very nice-really first class.""  Catherine Booker could not believe her eyes. ""It's awesome; I already joined because I have made a commitment to work out.""  Jack Mullins and his wife, Susan, were equally impressed. ""We love it!"" they said, ""and are pleased and surprised at all the wonderful equipment.""  Stafford Mayor Scarcella joined in the enthusiasm. ""I'm glad to be part of the christening of this facility and hope to be back on a regular basis to play tennis,"" he said. ""I commend Missouri City for a truly outstanding facility-it's really something to be proud of.""

It's been a couple of years since I last visited Yosemite, and after spending the last year based in Shanghai I was champing at the bit to get back out into one of my favourite locations on the West Coast of America.  I suppose the combination of excitement and jetlag were to blame for me getting very little sleep the night before (with the long drive to and from Lake Tahoe the day before not taking it's toll as I expected it to either).  After heading out the door of my hotel in Sunnyvale around 5am, I was entering the boundary of Yosemite around 9am, too late for sunrise but early enough to beat the main flock of tourists who would decend on the park in the hours which followed.  I was rather disappointed to learn that the Glacier Point road had been closed overnight due to recent snowfall, after it being opened for around a week before my visit.  My plan of shooting half dome and it's buddies with snow caps on from Glacier Point was scuppered, so instead I made the most of my time wandering around the meadows of the valley floor, enjoying the ever-awesome view from ""tunnel view"" and the majestic scenery surrounding Mirror Lake.  You can bet your bottom dollar that I'll be back to Yosemite as soon as I possibly can be to hopefully capture some snow caps from Glacier Point (and head up to Tenaya Lake) before the park fully embraces the summer months ahead."

The Army gave the Soldiers the day off so they could be part of the Super Bowl XLVII excitement and see it all live, even though theyre stationed half a world away. There was also plenty of food  free breakfasts at Area I clubs, an all-you-can-eat deal at the Camp Casey food court, as well as prize drawings for TV sets, i-Pads and other giveaways. For Soldiers and families stationed in Korea, catching the telecast live from the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans meant showing up early, with on-post facilities opening their doors at six. Free breakfast  eggs, grits, creamed beef, biscuits, bacon, sausage, hash browns, coffee, juice   awaited them at a variety of on-post facilities: at the Gateway Club and Warriors Club on Camp Casey, the Iron Triangle on Camp Hovey, Reggies on Camp Stanley, and Mitchells Community Club and Conference Center on Camp Red Cloud.  That was followed later in the morning by still more food  at Mitchells, for example, hot wings, fried wings and hot dogs; at the Gateway, three kinds of pizza   pepperoni, sausage, cheese  the spread varied somewhat from club to club. And the Camp Casey Food Court drew a Super Bowl crowd of its own  about 230 people, offering all-you-can-eat for $11.99, for which patrons could order continually from the eateries of their choice. Soldiers said they were glad for the live game, the food and the chance to socialize with their battle buddies. I think its generous cause its not a given, its a privilege, Pvt. Luis Campos, a Ravens fan with the 552nd Signal Company, said of being given the day off to watch the game. For them doing that, it takes the stress off the Soldiers, especially us being overseas and stuff. Everybody back home, they get a chance to watch the game. So now we get the privilege and stuff, so it makes it better. I really appreciate it, especially being here in Korea, said Spc. Austin Ross of Company B, Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, 2nd Infantry Division. Ross had been pulling for the 49ers. Had there not been the Super Bowl holiday, Ross would have been at work. Its in the morning, itd be during work, and its something American that I get to do here in Korea. I appreciate it, he said. This is great, said Sgt. 1st Class Randy Waits, a motor sergeant and 49ers fan with Headquarters Support Company, Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, 2nd Infantry Division. Its great the way they provide the opportunity for the Soldiers to see this and be able to come together, be overseas, away from our families. Just like a holiday. Being able to come together and socialize."

excitement,http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8171/7933438222_4f5c580756_z.jpg,1,4,"The Story Of An Endangered Gymnast This is our little girl, Emma Rose. Out of five kids, she is the only female we have. She is second to last, and she is the reason we had one more child. We liked her so much that we thought it a good idea to try for another sweet angel. It was then that little Sam came along. My wife likes to joke that if we had Sam first, he would have been our last. We love all of our kids very much, but Sam is something else. His story is one better suited for another time. I am here to talk about Miss Rose.  From her start, she has done well at everything she tried. She was quick to walk, and quicker than her older brother to master the bicycle. Her spirit is easy going; her loves for the challenges of life were consistently quite evident. She has always been a sweetheart. One year ago, she embarked upon the journey to become an expensive sweetheart. How? We signed her up for gymnastics.  My wife found a lovely gym somewhat close to us in the town of Denver, Pa. It is run by some really great folks, including Miss Kristi, Miss Barb and Mister Bob. Within one month of her beginner class, Emma was moved up to a progressive class. By March, she was a level three and by May, she was considered a pre-level four. By mid-summer, Emma Rose was a certified level four gymnast and her star was shining bright. Whenever my wife picked up our little girl from the gym, her instructors had nothing but praise for her dedication to the sport. They would say things like, Shes a natural and a great student. We only have to show her something once, and she gets it. The problem is that each time our gymnast rose in the ranks, so did the dollar amount required to keep her enrolled. Besides the basic fee for instruction, we were now faced with the cost of uniforms and soon there will be competition fees. Whats a struggling Daddy to do?  My bride and I wrestled with what should be done. She asked me weeks ago to write a letter to our friends and family about the situation and to let them know a booster account has been set up for donations. I resisted doing that because I am too proud for such a thing. Besides, I make a comfortable living as a truck driver. We dont live an extravagant lifestyle by any means since I think it is beneficial to keep my wife home while she raises our children. In addition to that, there are hungry kids and families in far worse situations than I am. I suggested we give Emma a break for gymnastics, and my wife agreed. When my wife told Emma that we were considering that option, tears welled up in her eyes. I cannot handle my daughter showing such emotion, especially when those feelings are attached to a sport that she loves, and one that I believe could teach her to be successful at other activities throughout her life. Maybe it was time to reconsider what my wife suggested I do in the first place, leave my pride at the door, and get to writing.  I honestly had no choice. We never really told the people at the gym why Emma hadnt been there. (Were not really horrible people or parents. We were simply trying to figure everything out.) One day, Miss Barb called to inquire why Emma Rose hadnt been around. My wife broke the news that we were really struggling with the monetary issues and were considering pulling Emma from the program until we could afford to. She also told Miss Barb that we were not expecting the cost to rise so quickly from $38 a month at the start to much more than that. Miss Barb, gentle soul that she is, would hear none of that. She told my wife that it was unacceptable not to have Emma in gymnastics. Miss Barb told my wife not to worry about the money and just get her back. It was her gym, she said, and we would find a way to make things work. She also said that if she didnt think that our daughter was worth it, she would have let it go. However, she could not, and with that, Emma returned. My wife tells me Emma gave Miss Barb a gigantic hug and jumped into Mister Bobs arms upon her return. Everyone, including my wife, were just about in tears.  I never wanted to pull my daughter from gymnastics. During the small amounts of time that I am actually home, its all she does. Yesterday, I caught her doing some kind of flips on her bed, and its never unusual to see her practicing routines in the open space of our living room. I cannot forget last week, when her mother pulled into the driveway with Emma in the backseat, home from another visit to the gym. I was sitting on the porch, and Emma came running up to me full of excitement and said, Daddy, Daddy! Guess what I learned today? She told me it was some kind of back handspring thing. I cant recall the actual name of what it was. I am certain that if I tried it, I would be immobilized for life. All of these things demonstrate that Emma Rose has a real passion for gymnastics. To be good at them and keep learning new routines are her dream. Its my duty as her Daddy to nurture that dream, and I will do the best that I can, including asking for help if need be.  Its not going to be easy. The yearly expense at this moment is in excess of $2500. The good news is that Emma now has a booster account for donations from people that would like to help her. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the Hoover family for donating three hundred dollars into Emmas account. They lost their daughter Lexy very suddenly in February of 2011. Lexy was a level four gymnast, like my daughter is now, and shared my daughters love and dedication to the sport.  The Hoover family set up a scholarship in their daughters memory.  Its purpose is to help kids compete in a sport that their daughter loved who could otherwise not afford to do so. My wife and I are blessed to have people like the Hoovers in our life. My heart goes out to them for their loss, and for their dedication in honoring the memory of their daughter by doing something she enjoyed herself.  There is hardly any doubt that little Lexy is smiling down from a cloud in heaven, dancing in delight in watching her brothers and sisters practice and learn the sport that was so dear to her.  If you would like to contribute to Emmas career as a gymnast, the information on how to participate can be found below. I have also created a Facebook page for you to follow her progress. I intend to add pictures of her in competitions and also let Emma fill you in on her activities and thoughts. You can find her page at:   www.facebook.com/EmmaRoseGymnast.  While the donations would be helping my daughter, I think it is my duty as her Dad to help her see the value in all of this. As unlikely as it seems now, there is a chance that she could encounter frustrations and struggles as her age and career move forward. If those moments were to occur, I will gently prod her to work through them.  Her mother and I will remind her of how many people believed in her enough to help her arrive at whatever difficult moment she is contending with. I will also make sure she understands the value of giving. Should she become more successful than all of our wildest dreams, I will be there to congratulate her. Ill also remind her of the importance of helping others if she doesnt demonstrate the ability on her own.  I would also like to add that I have another plan that will benefit us all. Someday, some gentleman might come to me and ask me if he could marry my daughter. If I liked him enough, I would answer, Sure, as long as you pay back all these people that helped my daughter become the successful gymnast whom she is, with 20% interest of course. If he actually repaid the debt, you would, in fact, make money on your investment. A part of me hopes that he cannot. Then, my princess will be mine forever. Thank-you for taking the time to read this story.  I only have one daughter in this world, and I hope I have said everything right. I have tried my best. I learned it from my little girl.  If you Would like to help support Emma in her Gymnast aspirations, you may send a check payable to KB Booster with Emma's name in the memo section to :  Emma Harry Booster C/O KB Gymnastics 130 N Blainsport Road Reinholds, PA. 17569"

L'immagine non pu essere usata in nessun caso senza autorizzazione scritta dell'autore. Per contatti: mairo.cinquetti@gmail.com  From the opening squeals of the guitars of Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman and the punishing breakaway attack of Dave Lombardo's drums on ""Flesh Storm"" it's clear from the first thirty seconds the thrash metal titans have returned to pummel listeners with a raging onslaught of new music guaranteed to lay waste to MP3 players, car stereo speakers and whatever else gets in their way. Christ Illusion marks the long-awaited return of the legendary Slayer. Its first record in five years and its first record in fifteen years with the original band line-up, Christ Illusion is a cacophony of brutality. A soundtrack for the post-Apocalypse. Steeped in scorching riffs and a litany of menacing tracks/tirades on religion and violence, Slayer forges ahead on its devastating path of aural destruction with ten new songs, each charged with the electric hostility for which Slayer is renowned. Of the record Kerry King is ecstatic: ""I love it. I really like God Hates Us All and I think that's the best record we've done in my opinion since Seasons In The Abyss, and I like this better than that one. I think it's a more complete record, I think sonically it better: all the performances are awesome. I think this one is more intense not because we're trying to do 'Reign In Blood: The Sequel,' it's just that's where our writing is taking us now."" Songs like the ""Flesh Storm,"" ""Eyes of the Insane,"" ""Skeleton Christ,"" ""Jihad"" and the first single, ""Cult"" showcase the band at its most blazing intensity. The sonic excitement of speed, propelled by King, Hanneman and Lombardo and lead by the immutable roar of Tom Araya provoke the listener with Slayer's trademark fascination with terror, violence and religion. For as long as Slayer has been making records it has been surrounded by controversy. Since the band recorded its first album, ""Show No Mercy,"" Slayer has been plagued with accusations of Satanism, fascism, racism and so on. Christ Illusion gives no quarter to critics who would mindlessly attack the band for, what the Germans call, ""der Reiz des Unbekannten"" (meaning ""the attraction of the unknown""). A lyric fascination with violence and terror which guitarist King enthusiastically describes this way: ""When I was I kid I would see a horror movie over a love story. Being shocked, being in an environment that's not reality might be frightening but is cool nonetheless. With a lot of our songs we put people in that place. It doesn't bother me because I enjoy it. It could easily be programming from all the fucking news channels."" Slayer is often assailed for its subject matter, though the band is unrepentant. "" According to Araya, ""Violence, darkness... So much of my inspiration comes from news articles or pictures and just start describing the images. Television- A&E, the History Channel, Court TV, Documentaries."" The singer continues, ""With this record, as far as a theme: there is none. That's just our favorite subject matter. The common thread is death. I think that's just a common thread in general: we all share death, and we all share it at different times in different ways, but it's the one thing that we all have in common. We all die. It's how we live that makes us different."" Beyond being controversial Slayer is an exceptional force in music, highly praised for its trailblazing style of fast, heavy and aggressive music yet bristling with melody. The much-heralded return of Dave Lombardo to the drummer's throne will leave fans gasping for breath as he clobbers the listener on song after song. Commenting on Lombardo's return to the fold, King notes, ""Not to say the shine's worn off, but it's old news to us. I think the thing the kids are going to get into, besides just being the first Slayer album in five years, is that Dave's on it. When he came back he wasn't a member, he just came back to do a couple of tours and people started asking back then 'Is he gonna hang around?' And I would tell them that was up to Dave. But I could tell that Dave was having a killer time."" King confided. ""So it was just a matter of time before he said, 'Yeah, let's do it!' But it's great. And now that he's got a new Slayer album that he's played on, I think he's going to get some more enjoyment out of playing. He takes pride in everything he does and it's awesome to have him back with us."" Having the original members record their first album together in fifteen years is certainly newsworthy but the lasting might of the band and its continued popularity is an achievement few can boast. For each of the members, the band is resolute. There is no other band like Slayer. ""The staying power behind Slayer is that we've stuck to our guns,"" Says Araya. ""Integrity... that would be number one. A lot of it has to do with the fact that we've stuck to what we do best. And the fact that we've been together as a band for so long. Ten years with Dave; another ten without Dave; and now Dave's back. It has a lot to do with compromise, that's just the way it has to be. You have to be able to compromise and give and take and that has a lot to do with why we're still together and a force to be reckoned with. I've learned that without each other, Slayer wouldn't exist, and that the whole is greater than its parts."" Kerry King is far more succinct. ""Slayer to me is the coolest band on the planet. There is a timeless quality to Slayer. It's cool, but I can't explain it. It's our life."" Slayer has created one mesmerizing record after the next, has influenced many of today's most successful bands, including Slipknot, Sepultura, Killswitch Engage, and continues to earn new generations of fans, while staying true to its ceaselessly devoted followers. Slayer's legacy is cemented in music forever and the band remains undaunted in its directive to make punishing, aggressive and exciting music. With Christ Illusion the band marks its territory. Slayer has exceeded itself far beyond thrash metal to become an unstoppable juggernaut without equal. Tom Araya sums it up: ""I think the best thing is the band's longevity and the fact that we haven't bowed to anyone. That we were able to make a record like Reign In Blood, which, to us, was just another record, but to others, was something very special, it's had such an impact. People will remember it for a long time, and it's all because we did things our way, we didn't bow down to anyone. We didn't compromise. We stuck to being who we are."""

I spent NYE on Granville St in Vancouver BC with two other fantastic photographers capturing the fun of the evening. We lined up side-by-side, many people thought we were with a newspaper or that we knew something really amazing was just about to take place and they asked what it was and wanted to watch too. I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over. I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol. I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.   Some of the photos might seem a bit strange with the movement/blur but I find them artistic and you can find some interesting pictures within a photo when you let yourself just look without expectations. You may also notice the odd clear face/s that paused in all the movement & excitement. All in all, everyone was having a fantastic time!!

Participating in this event was a fantastic way to share my excitement for science and engineering as it applies to our world and the next generation, said ECBC Chemical Engineer Cindy Learn. The idea of having inspired at least one student to pursue a STEM career pathway makes all of our efforts worthwhile.     Students that visited ECBCs educational outreach booth area were put into the shoes of real U.S. Army scientists and engineers. Charged with the task to design and test water filtration systems, they infused their creativity and imagination into the development process.  We learned ways to build our own water filters using different materials [like coffee filters, wipes, sand and gravel], said Christopher Black, who is eight years old and attends Chesterbrook Elementary School in McLean, Va. Now we can go home and try it again.  In addition, students identified unknown white powders with a portable device using a laser detection technique that generated a spectral fingerprint based on the chemical bonds in the unknown substances.   I thought it was interesting to see how technology has advanced, said 12th grade student Kelles Gordge, who is enrolled in the STEM Program at Great Mills High School in Maryland. Ive worked with similar devices, but it was very exciting to experience the use of this smaller version.  Tenth-grade student Shane Welsh from Aberdeens Science and Math Academy had the opportunity to attend this years Science & Engineering Festival and attested to the success of the event.  If I had to choose between the Festival and my next paycheck, I'd choose the Festival,"" he said.     "

History tells us that ancient people started living along rivers which serves as the first passage for travel connecting them with other colonies and settlements found along the same river.   Today the river do not only serves as a conduit for travel but also serves as connecting link for other forms of activities such as sports, etc. On this occasion photos were shared as part of the paid tour package by the unnamed managing agency.

The name was used for the top models in Ford's full-size range from 1959 until 1961, in a marketing attempt to appeal to the excitement surrounding the Space Race. In 1962, all full-size Fords wore the Galaxie badge, with ""500"" and ""500/XL"" denoting the higher series. The Galaxie 500/LTD was introduced for 1965 followed by the Galaxie 500 7-Litre in 1966. The Galaxie 500 part was dropped from the LTD in 1966, and from the XL in 1967; however the basic series structuring levels were maintained. The ""regular"" Galaxie 500 continued below the LTD as Ford's mid-level full-size model from 1965 until its demise at the end of the 1974 model year.  The Galaxie was the high volume counterpart to the Chevrolet Impala. Some Galaxies were high-performance, racing specification machines, a larger forebear to the muscle car era. Others were plain family sedans.  The 1966 four-door sedan version of this car was also produced in Brazil under the names Galaxie 500, LTD and Landau from 1967 to 1983. The similarly named Ford Galaxy is a large car/minivan available in the European market. The vehicle's name is taken from the original Ford Galaxie.  (Wikipedia)"

While the temperature outside continued to rise, so did the fun and excitement. All the children had plenty of water breaks and extra time swimming to keep cool. Even the threat of rain didnt dampen our spirits. We had the opportunity to have an extra special snack of sandwich cookies decorated with icing and jimmies.  This weeks theme was Finding Nemo, and the Tadpoles and Minnows created CD fish door hangers in Camper Creations. At Ceramics, the campers enjoyed painting their clay hands and feet. All your childrens projects will be sent home shortly. On Wednesday, in preparation for Waterworld and to honor our weekly theme of Finding Nemo, many of our Tadpoles and Minnows attempted the giant water slide and loved it.  To end our wonderful week, The Willows campers joined the rest of camp at Waterworld. The children drove water boats and joined in other great water activities. A terrific time was had by all!  We are looking forward to the next four weeks with your children. As a reminder, please remember to label all items brought to camp and wear yellow as much as possible.

I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over. I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol. I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.   Some of the photos might seem a bit strange with the movement/blur but I find them artistic and you can find some interesting pictures within a photo when you let yourself just look without expectations. You may also notice the odd clear face/s that paused in all the movement & excitement. All in all, everyone was having a fantastic time!!

This is the amazing story of two Ethiopian marathon runners  Sintayehi Legese Yinesu (28) and Meseret Mengistu Biru (26)  who each pocketed R100 000 after respectively clinching victory in the mens and womens categories of the 42,2km race of the new-look Soweto Marathon on Sunday.  Yinesu finished the race in 2 hours 17 minutes, while Biru made it in 2 hours 36 minutes.  The sensational way in which the duo cruised to victory was all the marathon needed to relaunch itself after it was briefly put off course by internal wrangling in Athletics South Africa.  The 2012 champion, Shadrack Kemboi of Kenya, also took part but failed to place in the top three positions, such was the intensity of the competition.  The Soweto Marathon is back with a bang, elated Soweto Marathon Director and Organiser Banele Sindane exclaimed. And its here to stay. Our aim is to grow the race so it can be counted among the best in the world. Already, the race has made a name for itself.  Earlier  at 6am to be exact  there was a sense of anticipation and excitement as Johannesburg Executive Mayor Mpho Parks Tau signalled the start of the marathon at the Nasrec Exhibition Centre outside Soweto.  Gauteng Premier David Makhura was one of the celebrities at the starting point to take part in the marathon.  More than 20 000 runners took part in this years marathon, which was divided into three: 42,2km race, 21,1km race and 10km race.  The weather, which can be a spoil sport sometimes, also did not disappoint. It was a mild and glorious day, perfect for running.  Yinesu and Biru were not the only foreigners who dominated the marathon. In the main mens race, Lesotho nationals Tebogo Sello and Motlokoa Nkhabutlane took second and third positions respectively. In the womens main race, it was Isabella Jepchumba of Kenya who came second.  But South Africans were not to be completely outdone. Joel Moni gallantly clinched victory in the 21,1km mens race, while Xoliswa Ntshali came second. The womens version of the race was won by Mapaseka Makhanya.  Both Galant and Makhanya won R10 000 each for their remarkable efforts.  Desmond Mokgobu outran and outpaced his challengers to win the 10km mens race, pocketing R5 000 in prize-money in the process. Lebogang won the womens race and also received R5 000 for her efforts.  Johannesburgs municipal-owned entities such as JMPD and the Emergency Management Services were on hand to make the marathon an incident-free and memorable event.  Mayor Tau fully supports the marathon as it eloquently speaks to the Citys Healthy Lifestyle Programme, which encourages Johannesburg residents to engage in physical activities such as running, walking and cycling to improve their health and enhance the citys life expectancy.  Sponsors such as Nike, Nedbank, Coca-Cola and the National Lottery contributed to the success of this years edition of the marathon.

I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol. I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.   Some of the photos might seem a bit strange with the movement/blur but I find them artistic and you can find some interesting pictures within a photo when you let yourself just look without expectations. You may also notice the odd clear face/s that paused in all the movement & excitement. All in all, everyone was having a fantastic time!!  If you see yourself in any of the pictures on my Facebook page, please tag yourself and then share the photos to your friends & family. If you like my page then you will get notified for when I post the rest of the pictures which are coming soon! www.facebook.com/AnnaHallPhotographer  Thank YOU for posing for me and bringing such great energy to NYE!!"

It was a perfect day out - sun shining, calm waters, and a sense of relaxation. Before we knew it my husband snagged a fish. Not much longer my son caught his first one. He actually thought his lure got stuck in the rocks....again. The excitement in his eyes, and the pride he had when he realized it was actually a fish and not rocks or weeds was priceless. I quickly grabbed my camera and took this pic. Of course we let the fish back into the lake - an amazing first timer experience. Since that first moment, I fell in love with fishing.

Well, do ya, nerf herder?  Couldn't let Marc and Cathy have all the fun playing with toys, could I?   Seeing Marc's pictures with his Stormtrooper minifig reminded me how much the Stormtrooper scowl looks like Dirty Harry Callahan. Broke out my own minifig, and tried to get the pose as close as I could (even built a little background with some of the kids LEGO bricks). Lighting is from camera right with a bare bulb in a reflector, with a white bounce camera left to reduce the shadows a hair and get some definition on the very tip of the blaster. Shot four shots with macro tubes at /16, varying the focus on each shot, then did focus stacking in Photoshop to get the whole minifig in focus. Tried to process the shot to look at least a little like old film. I'm very happy with the end result.  Mikon D7000 w/Nikkor 18-200mm @ 200mm, 68mm macro extension tubes, 0.5s @ /16, ISO100."

Thrilled Casey crowd goes wild for American Idols  By Kevin Jackson kevin.b.jackson1.civ@mail.mil  CAMP CASEY, South Korea  It was a love affair between Idols and their fans.  Eight top American Idol finishers from the past three seasons brought their brand of Hollywood entertainment here for the troops, civilian employees and their families, a mere 11 miles from the DMZ. Idol favorites Creighton Fraker, Jen Hirsh, Jovany Javier, Ashthon Jones, Aaron Marcellus, John Wayne Schulz, Lauren Turner and Rachel Zevita gave as much as they got during the Idols World Tour performance.  The Idols collectively kicked off the nearly two-hour performance with the Black Eyed Peas I Gotta Feeling which spent 14 weeks atop the Billboard Top 100 in 2009.  Ten songs into the 36-lick concert, Idols host Javier addressed the nearly 700 gathered in Carey Fitness Center.  Were really excited to be here, Camp Casey, said the handsome, bilingual 24-year-old of Cuban descent. Were so thankful and privileged to be performing for you all.  The performance amounted to a musical parade through the past six decades, reaching as far back as Neil Diamonds Sweet Caroline from 1969. But more recent years were well represented  no fewer than 26 were hits from the past decade.  Many were performed on the American Idol TV show.  The sexy and beauteous Jones, all in black except for turquoise high heels, whipped the troops into a frenzy serenading several of the 20 Soldiers gathered on stage with Justin Biebers up-tempo rhythm and blues hit, Baby. She went on to wow them with Beyonces Love on Top and duets of I Will Follow and Dont You Wanna Stay with Marcellus and Schulz, respectively.  Schulz, a 24-year-old cowboy from Karnes City, Texas, who released an album Ropin Dreams at 14, appealed to the crowd with country favorites like Chicken Fried, Friends in Low Places and American Soldier, the latter drawing thunderous applause and a standing ovation.  The concert ended with an encore to the 1981 Journey anthem Dont Stop Believin. Soldiers from the 302nd Brigade Support Battalion and from each troop of the 4th Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment, joined the performers on stage  in such a state of excitement they were jumping up and down as they lifted their respective unit colors and sang along heartily with their favorite Idols.  At the conclusion, Brig. Gen. J. B. Burton, deputy commanding general of maneuvers, 2nd Infantry Division, presented the Idols with a memento of their visit  a framed tomahawk  symbolic of the Indianhead division.  This is to remind you that its always Warrior time, he said to the performers.  Pvt. Rebekah Krylo from Battery G, 1st Battalion, 15th Field Artillery, had spent most of the nearly two hours on her feet near the stage.   She recalls watching American Idol since its first season and wasnt disappointed.  It was awesome, the 21-year-old Bueno Park, Calif. native said. I loved it! They were very entertaining and crowd-motivating. I enjoyed it immensely.  The Idols took time to pose with their fans for photographs after the show.  If the fans were thrilled with the Idols, some post-concert social media postings showed the Idols were thrilled with the fans.  Just finished a show here at Camp Casey in Korea!!!! The crowd was AWESOME!!!!!!!!, Jones said via her Twitter account.  Just had our first show for South Korean and American Soldiersfeeling super humbled and all warm and fuzzy, said Hirsh on her official Web site.  The Idols also had a short meet-and-greet performance for the troops at Camp Bonifas the day before.  The concert was part of Armed Forces Entertainments worldwide tour that began June 28 at Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Greece. The tour  is scheduled to end at Naval Base Guam Aug. 24."

This is the amazing story of two Ethiopian marathon runners  Sintayehi Legese Yinesu (28) and Meseret Mengistu Biru (26)  who each pocketed R100 000 after respectively clinching victory in the mens and womens categories of the 42,2km race of the new-look Soweto Marathon on Sunday.  Yinesu finished the race in 2 hours 17 minutes, while Biru made it in 2 hours 36 minutes.  The sensational way in which the duo cruised to victory was all the marathon needed to relaunch itself after it was briefly put off course by internal wrangling in Athletics South Africa.  The 2012 champion, Shadrack Kemboi of Kenya, also took part but failed to place in the top three positions, such was the intensity of the competition.  The Soweto Marathon is back with a bang, elated Soweto Marathon Director and Organiser Banele Sindane exclaimed. And its here to stay. Our aim is to grow the race so it can be counted among the best in the world. Already, the race has made a name for itself.  Earlier  at 6am to be exact  there was a sense of anticipation and excitement as Johannesburg Executive Mayor Mpho Parks Tau signalled the start of the marathon at the Nasrec Exhibition Centre outside Soweto.  Gauteng Premier David Makhura was one of the celebrities at the starting point to take part in the marathon.  More than 20 000 runners took part in this years marathon, which was divided into three: 42,2km race, 21,1km race and 10km race.  The weather, which can be a spoil sport sometimes, also did not disappoint. It was a mild and glorious day, perfect for running.  Yinesu and Biru were not the only foreigners who dominated the marathon. In the main mens race, Lesotho nationals Tebogo Sello and Motlokoa Nkhabutlane took second and third positions respectively. In the womens main race, it was Isabella Jepchumba of Kenya who came second.  But South Africans were not to be completely outdone. Joel Moni gallantly clinched victory in the 21,1km mens race, while Xoliswa Ntshali came second. The womens version of the race was won by Mapaseka Makhanya.  Both Galant and Makhanya won R10 000 each for their remarkable efforts.  Desmond Mokgobu outran and outpaced his challengers to win the 10km mens race, pocketing R5 000 in prize-money in the process. Lebogang won the womens race and also received R5 000 for her efforts.  Johannesburgs municipal-owned entities such as JMPD and the Emergency Management Services were on hand to make the marathon an incident-free and memorable event.  Mayor Tau fully supports the marathon as it eloquently speaks to the Citys Healthy Lifestyle Programme, which encourages Johannesburg residents to engage in physical activities such as running, walking and cycling to improve their health and enhance the citys life expectancy.  Sponsors such as Nike, Nedbank, Coca-Cola and the National Lottery contributed to the success of this years edition of the marathon.

It was very exciting to have all of our Willows family members join us for our visiting day. We are so glad that so many parents and grandparents shared in the fun.  While the temperature outside continued to rise, so did all the excitement. With the extremely hot weather, we changed our schedule to include more indoor activities. This helped both the campers and counselors stay as cool as possible. Of course, we added additional swim periods and encouraged lots of water breaks to help everyone beat the heat.  On Tuesday we had a surprise visit from the Glee Club who performed two fabulous songs. The Willows really had fun singing a repeat after me song with them. Uncle Teek, from security, also joined us for a delicious lunch the same day.  This weeks theme was Under the Sea. The Tadpoles and Minnows painted and decorated Goldfish Sun Catchers. In Ceramics, the campers enjoyed painting their clay hands and feet. All your childrens projects will be sent home shortly.   Picture day for The Willows was a huge success as the campers and staff had big smiles on their faces. Your copy will be sent home at the end of the summer.  The week ended with The Willows campers joining the main camp at Waterworld. They drove water boats, enjoyed climbing on the floats and sliding into a counselors arms. A terrific time was had by all!! Pictures of this wonderful event will be posted early next week.  We are looking forward to the next four weeks with.

After 7 long years of silence local cult band Reverend Glasseye returns as a shaken and somber beast to kick off this frightful night of fun! Emerging in the 90s as one of the originators of the East coast's dark cabaret movement, the band solidified its place on the scene with its junk aesthetic and operatic bravadocombining American and East European folk music to eventually win Boston's Rock and Roll Rumble in 2005.

Even the most diehard athletes and boosters would be hard-pressed, however, to match the intensity and staying power of the fund-raising efforts backing Holmes Desmelik and Amber Rhodes.  Visit Brevard High School any day of the week to observe ""Holmes Team"" and ""Amber's Angels"" fervently chasing their goals on behalf of these fellow students.  Both Amber and Holmes suffer from cancers which cannot be fully eradicated (if at all) through surgery.  In honor of both students, Blue Devils purchased headbands for a dollar apiece, then gathered on October 9th for a star-shaped photo to honor the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation.  In the end, that first wave raised over $1,200 for the teams (see our album).  Graphics teacher Katrina Ronneburger (BHS) said, ""I wanted to help my students come up with a way they could show support for Amber Rhodes - a senior from BHS - and Holmes - whose mother Clare teaches Spanish at BHS. Both of these families have a child that's been diagnosed with a brain tumor. We came up with 'Headbands 4 Hope,' and my students jumped all over it!   ""The campaign was run through my club (BHS Graphics Club) We sold almost 100 the 1st day without any promotion. My students made posters to put all over school - and it went crazy from there.  ""Several students made generous donations and only expected one headband, others bought $20 worth to pass out to friends. We did have several anonymous donations to raise our final total to $1200.00. We donated $600 to the Desmelik family and $600 to 'Make-A-Wish' for Amber's Team.""  Clare Desmelik added, ""Thanks for showing support for our families.  Holmes was diagnosed with a tumor in his thalamus, which most doctors consider inoperable.  Right now his tumor is stable and Holmes is enjoying kindergarten. He is a great little guy with a heart of gold.  One of his goals for this year is to make a green stamp for good behavior every single day at school and not to have to get a warning from his teachers.  ""There has been an incredible amount of love and support pouring in from the community.  Our friends and Holmes' friends, many churches and small businesses have all been so generous.  I am so blessed to work in such a wonderful school system.  The folks at TCS have overwhelmed us with support.  Faculty from all of the schools have reached out, as well as the good people at the Central Office.  BHS had our back from the very first day that our world changed with his diagnosis.  The faculty, the students and their families have boosted our spirits and helped in so many ways.  The staff at BES has made Holmes feel so welcomed and Holmes sure knows his way around the high school as well!  Students and staff alike make Holmes feel like the star he is!  ""The pie challenge on October 17th is something we called 'Whipping Childhood Cancer' in order to raise awareness and send love to Amber and the Rhodes Family, as well as raise money for Make a Wish, one of Amber's favorite charities.    ""Amber's brother Garrett challenged us with this earlier this year and we of course accepted and paid it forward to 7 others, helping to raise money for the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation.  We were ready for more pies and excitement...Holmes was especially looking forward to it!""  To follow up, a group of BHS teachers have organized  ""Rent-a- Student"" to help raise money for Holmes Team to cover mounting medical bills. The registration page is located at bit.ly/rent-a-student-2014.  Holmes also has a facebook page that many in our county are already following that keeps people up to date on how things are going and of events planned.  www.facebook.com/groups/holmesteam    Honestly, we have been humbled by the love, and he Holmes Team motto is ""Love Heals.""

There was personal redemption, too, for Carli Lloyd, who answered her missed kick in that 3-1 shootout loss by scoring a goal in each half to seal the Olympic crown for her nation.  Japan were dubbed the Barcelona of the women's game for their flurry of neat passing and slick movement and their average height of 5ft 4in compared to the US's 5ft 7in. The Americans were the big tournament specialists. This was the fifth women's Olympic final and USA were continuing their record of being in all of them, losing only to Norway at Sydney 2000, 3-2.  For Japan, their coach Norio Sasaki framed the attempted conquest of gold as part of the country's healing process, following the trauma of last year's earthquake which killed nearly 20,000 people.  Ahead of this final he said: ""All the Japanese people are still trying to come back from the earthquake disaster.  ""Winning the World Cup was very emotional last year and gave energy to the nation after what had happened and the same can happen again.""  After eight minutes a noisy, though not completely filled Wembley, witnessed the opening strike. Tobin Heath galloped into space down the left before Alex Morgan's twist and cross was met by Carli Lloyd, just ahead of the 143-goal Abby Wambach.  Far from being unsettled, Japan went in search of an instant reply. A shot from Nahomi Kawasumi was blocked by the USA captain, Christie Rampone, with Hope Solo, the keeper, stranded. Yuki Ogimi followed up but could not convert.  Ogimi went closer moments later. A hanging jump was followed by the forward's header being superbly palmed onto the bar b y Solo.  The goal-frame proved an extra defender for both sides. Amy LePeilbet's cross was met with a glancing header by Rampone that hit Yuki Fukomoto's right post. At the opposite end, Aya Miyama's pile-driver smashed back off the bar.  Ogimi was instrumental in every Japan attack. Her lay-off nine minutes from half-time was hit with a menacing curl by Shinobu Ohno but the ball was marginally wide of the post.  The open, entertaining nature of this contest continued after the break. Japan spread the ball across midfield only for their attacks to founder due to a belief deficit. When given sight of goal  as Miyama, the captain, on 52 minutes  the opportunity was snatched at.  When America flooded forward there was menace. After Megan Rapinoe laid the ball into Lloyd, she surged from near half-way then unloaded a 20-yard humdinger that gave the 5ft 4in keeper Fukumoto no chance, and that was 2-0 to Pia Sunhage's team.  In the 63nd minute Japan's Ogimi raised the excitement scale to fevered after her strike, though this proved a consolation as the neat triangles that were ending in cul-de-sacs continued to frustrate the Japanese.  The world champions still had their chances but when Miyama had two free-kicks to deliver in quick succession, her side failed to profit."

The theme of the event was Definitely Dallas! due to Omnis dedication to make each of their hotels look authentic to its location. On Friday, the first full day of the excitement-packed weekend, meeting planners chose to visit Cowboys Stadium, Southfork Ranch with J.R. Ewing himself, the famous Larry Hagman, or Texas Motor Speedway. Later that evening, planners attended Dallas Double Take event put on by DCVB where planners were encouraged by Mayor Rawlings, Larry Hagman and DCVB President Phillip Jones to take a second look at Dallas and the incredible attractions the city has to offer. Saturday brought more activities to experience in the busy Dallas area. Meeting planners visited the Old American Golf course, beautiful Dallas Arboretum and the Sixth Floor Museum. Other planners opted for the Whats new in Dallas? tour where they saw the Perot Museum of Nature and Science, expected to open in 2013, and the new Margaret Hunt-Hill Bridge, designed by Spanish Architect Santiago Calatrava. That evening, planners dressed in their best and went to the Gala Dinner hosted by MSNBCs Contessa Brewer. Planners dined while special guest Tim Halperin from American Idol performed his gorgeous piano melodies. At the after party, planners enjoyed a performance by country king and SMU alum Jack Ingram. The weekends festivities concluded the following morning with a farewell Gospel Brunch to send them back to their hometowns. The Omni Hotel in the heart of Downtown Dallas did a wonderful job introducing the meeting planners to our Dallas. Congratulations to the Omni Dallas Hotel on such a successful Grand Opening weekend. We hope when the meeting planners begin to plan their next meeting, they think Definitely Dallas! "

Yes, that eau de puppy is simply irresistible. Everyone wants to get a whiff of that cute puppy smell. He is a delight and provided you don't mind puppy bite marks on your limbs the little man loves a game and today his playmate was my niece Miss Cleo. There is nothing quite like the way the whole back half of a puppy wags in harmony with the tail or how they gallop and frolic, ears pinned back with excitement and paws everywhere. It's no wonder the number of unscheduled visitors has grown exponentially. Truth is we are having more visitors now than when we brought the new baby home 15 years ago. Truth is I am in a better prepared to welcome people in than in the new mum phase AND the pup is far more ready and willing to perform for visitors than a bub. It is also true that that both of he new arrivals create a fair amount of work by weeing and pooing all the time but it's a small price to pay. In the words of one unknown (at least to me) genius ""If you can look at a dog and not feel vicarious excitement and affection, you must be a cat. "

Despite snowy weather, families and friends arrived throughout the morning to enjoy an all-you-can-eat pancake breakfast with their loved ones.  There was a bake sale, operated by resident volunteers.  The variety of baked goods were sold and all monies went to the Resident Activities fund, to be used for special events and outings throughout the year.  There were also private vendors selling their wares, providing for some convenient holiday shopping.  Of course, the moment everyone was waiting for was the arrival of Santa. As the snow fell and the wind blew, some showed concern that Santa might not make it, but right on time, the doors opened and there stood Santa.  A wave of excitement and applause went through the crowd as Santa made his way to his chair next to the large Christmas tree.  ""Now this is my kinda weather!"" he shouted to the crowd as the children lined up.  Once the children finished telling Santa what they wanted, residents made their way to Santa's lap as well.  Staff and families soon followed suit as everyone wanted their picture with Santa.   Before Santa left, he drew a boy's name and a girl's name from the basket. Each child was given a FREE raffle ticket.  There were 2 giant baskets filled with toys and treats for the lucky boy and girl whose names were called. As the party came to a close, the winners were announced and the happy children collected their prizes.  There was also an adult raffle for a wine basket.  Tickets were $1.00 each and the money raised also went to the Resident Activity fund. ""I was worried that the weather would ruin the party."" Said Program Director, Angie Garbaczewski, ""Instead, it just created a beautiful back drop for it. We have our own White Christmas right here.""  "

While the temperature outside continued to rise, so did the fun and excitement. All the children had plenty of water breaks and extra time swimming to keep cool. Even the threat of rain didnt dampen our spirits. We had the opportunity to have an extra special snack of sandwich cookies decorated with icing and jimmies.  This weeks theme was Finding Nemo, and the Tadpoles and Minnows created CD fish door hangers in Camper Creations. At Ceramics, the campers enjoyed painting their clay hands and feet. All your childrens projects will be sent home shortly. On Wednesday, in preparation for Waterworld and to honor our weekly theme of Finding Nemo, many of our Tadpoles and Minnows attempted the giant water slide and loved it.  To end our wonderful week, The Willows campers joined the rest of camp at Waterworld. The children drove water boats and joined in other great water activities. A terrific time was had by all!  We are looking forward to the next four weeks with your children. As a reminder, please remember to label all items brought to camp and wear yellow as much as possible.

Landrake Moto Parc was founded in 1995 and is set in 25 acres of beautiful Cornish countryside, with the track taking approximately half of the site - the rest for paddock area and spectator parking. We also have another 10 acres for additional parking for the very large events. The track is 1900km long and is a minimum of 10 metres wide with some sections 15 metres wide and sits in a valley with trees on one side. With features such as a whoop section, raised berms, ski-ramps, step-downs and step-ups, and a laptime of over two minutes, exhilarating racing is ensured. 40 GP-standard start gates lead you to a 110 metre start straight, turning out into a wide downhill and then a chicane - followed by a very popular feature with spectators immediately in front of the pits - a table-top suitable for laying down some whips and scrubs, with a 100 foot tabletop right after! All this with superb viewing for specatators.   Whilst the track is fast and flowing, its a very technical track, with some old-school features such as adverse cambers and natural terrain, combined with some man-made jumps, along with a rythm section to add to the excitement for riders and spectators alike.

I spent NYE on Granville St in Vancouver BC with two other fantastic photographers capturing the fun of the evening. We lined up side-by-side, many people thought we were with a newspaper or that we knew something really amazing was just about to take place and they asked what it was and wanted to watch too. I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over. I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol. I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.   Some of the photos might seem a bit strange with the movement/blur but I find them artistic and you can find some interesting pictures within a photo when you let yourself just look without expectations. You may also notice the odd clear face/s that paused in all the movement & excitement. All in all, everyone was having a fantastic time!!

Plans for a man-made surfing lake near Bristol have been passed by South Gloucestershire Council.  The 6m The Wave: Bristol, one of the first of its kind in the country, will be built on greenbelt land outside Easter Compton in Almondsbury.  The attraction will be subject to approval by the Secretary of State.  Olympic snowboarder Jenny Jones spoke at the planning meeting and gave her support to the project, which was approved by nine votes to one.  Nick Hounsfield, chief executive of The Wave, the company behind the idea, said he felt ""relief, disbelief and utter excitement"" at the decision.  ""Really relieved. Partly for myself but partly for all the people that have helped us get this project to where it is at the moment,"" he added.  Mr Hounsfield said he believed the project could ""really inspire"" the next generation, while delivering ""so many social benefits"".  He also praised the council's ""vision"" in seeing the possibilities the 2,790 sq m (30,000 sq ft) attraction could offer.  Around the lake will be a natural swimming lake and multifunctional gardens Local people had been concerned about access to the site and how it would affect traffic.  Richard Jones, parish councillor for the Almondsbury area, said nearby roads were ""already very busy"".  Speaking at the meeting, Ms Jones from Downend said she believed the lake ""could provide a great facility"" for adults and children.  ""Just to be exposed to a sport that they might not be, and to carry that sport throughout their entire life,"" she added.  According to The Wave's website, the ""centrepiece"" surfing lake - which will use Wavegarden technology to create the ""world's longest waves"" - will be suitable for both professional surfers and beginners.  Around the lake will be a natural swimming lake and multifunctional gardens including an activity garden, barefoot trails, a sensory garden, healing garden, culinary garden, herb gardens and foraging areas.  Mr Hounsfield states he was ""pretty confident"" that the lake would be approved by the Secretary of State, with work beginning by next year.  www.the-wave.co.uk/Bristol/"

I spent NYE on Granville St in Vancouver BC with two other fantastic photographers capturing the fun of the evening. We lined up side-by-side, many people thought we were with a newspaper or that we knew something really amazing was just about to take place and they asked what it was and wanted to watch too. I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over. I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol.

There literally there is no bad place to fish presently. The simplest way to explain this is everyday of late, as I drift down the river in the boat, every single spot is producing fish, top to bottom of the river! Ye-Haa!! My guest's were in the 10% of the anglers that catch 90% of the Steelhead twice last week, with the other two days being ok #'s. The 2 ok average #'s of steelhead were attributed to the fish being in a transitional stage and being more spread out from the heat to the deeper pools. - (Photo) Rick (son of dad Dick K. photo'd below) w/ an exciting steelhead. Congrats!! - Guess we just got lucky this week ;) Monday - Enjoyed my first scheduled day off in the last few month's. - Tuesday - 500 cfs - My 2 guest's landed 3 steelhead (6-8-12 lb'r) out of 9 total played with! My new guest was visually shaking with excitement and adrenaline racing up his spine after fighting and landing his first ever steelhead. He said, Randy, this is the BEST fishing day of my life! I smiled in return and remembered fondly my first fish on the Salmon River and the excitement of it all. We captured the entire fight and landing of this steelhead on video. It was fun to watch and listen to it in replay as we slowly drifted down the river in the drift boat on ""The River, where Memories are Made."" - Wed. 6 reeeeeeeeel scream'n drag's singing the fisherman's national anthem steelhead were played with today off the .com drift boat by my two guest's. Just another day at the office. - Thurs. Had to work hard for every fish and we picked away at them. Noticed less fish in the heat then previous days, the fish are transitioning to the Winter lyes. Water temp. was approx. 40 degrees. We tied into 4 steelhead today - Father and son sharing a qaulity day of fond fishing memories and fun. Tyler took about 5-6 pictures of his dad's Trophy Steelhead that he kept for the dinner table. I suggested that w/ the holidays just around the corner he could make a photo colleague framed picture and make it into a holiday gift for his dad to hang on the wall. - Friday Noticed MOST of the bank anglers having success in ALL the normal spots. Bent rods, scream'n reels, smiles and laughter abound! I'd recommend coming over, up or down to fish. I'm seeing about 75% bright silver steelhead and approx. 25% darker steelhead. They darken a tad once they have been in the river 3-4 weeks. Thats how you can tell how fresh or old they are. Changed fishing strategy today, listened to the fish and was rewarded w/ an amazing 14 steelhead tangled with for my first timers. They flew in from the West coast where they fish a lot. They had always heard story's about this place and decided to give a fishing try. They were not disappointed. I think we well be seeing them again. - How I enjoyed my scheduled weekend off the water to work in the office: You can only turn your underwear inside out, soooo many times, before you HAVE to do your laundry :) - (Photo) Dick K. w/ a nice silver bullet.

So we decided to make use of the play equipment along the foreshore area. Benjamin had a ball on the bigger kids play area, going up and down the slide, giving Jane a heart attack climbing across the high up play equipment and having a fly on the flying fox. Then we spotted the little kids play equipment and headed over there. Benjamin loved the musical pipes but unfortunately because the play area didn't have a slide he grew impatient for excitement and adventure, so we left the little kids play area and headed back home.  However Benjamin's obsession with closing doors and gates made this a bit of a drawn out process as he kept closing the gate with him on the inside.  Eventually he learnt that he had to be on the outside of the gate to not be locked in.  He eventually left the gate and headed towards the car. Disappointing about not being able to go for a swim at the beach but we still all had fun at the play grounds."

Even the most diehard athletes and boosters would be hard-pressed, however, to match the intensity and staying power of the fund-raising efforts backing Holmes Desmelik and Amber Rhodes.  Visit Brevard High School any day of the week to observe ""Holmes Team"" and ""Amber's Angels"" fervently chasing their goals on behalf of these fellow students.  Both Amber and Holmes suffer from cancers which cannot be fully eradicated (if at all) through surgery.  In honor of both students, Blue Devils purchased headbands for a dollar apiece, then gathered on October 9th for a star-shaped photo to honor the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation.  In the end, that first wave raised over $1,200 for the teams (see our album).  Graphics teacher Katrina Ronneburger (BHS) said, ""I wanted to help my students come up with a way they could show support for Amber Rhodes - a senior from BHS - and Holmes - whose mother Clare teaches Spanish at BHS. Both of these families have a child that's been diagnosed with a brain tumor. We came up with 'Headbands 4 Hope,' and my students jumped all over it!   ""The campaign was run through my club (BHS Graphics Club) We sold almost 100 the 1st day without any promotion. My students made posters to put all over school - and it went crazy from there.  ""Several students made generous donations and only expected one headband, others bought $20 worth to pass out to friends. We did have several anonymous donations to raise our final total to $1200.00. We donated $600 to the Desmelik family and $600 to 'Make-A-Wish' for Amber's Team.""  Clare Desmelik added, ""Thanks for showing support for our families.  Holmes was diagnosed with a tumor in his thalamus, which most doctors consider inoperable.  Right now his tumor is stable and Holmes is enjoying kindergarten. He is a great little guy with a heart of gold.  One of his goals for this year is to make a green stamp for good behavior every single day at school and not to have to get a warning from his teachers.  ""There has been an incredible amount of love and support pouring in from the community.  Our friends and Holmes' friends, many churches and small businesses have all been so generous.  I am so blessed to work in such a wonderful school system.  The folks at TCS have overwhelmed us with support.  Faculty from all of the schools have reached out, as well as the good people at the Central Office.  BHS had our back from the very first day that our world changed with his diagnosis.  The faculty, the students and their families have boosted our spirits and helped in so many ways.  The staff at BES has made Holmes feel so welcomed and Holmes sure knows his way around the high school as well!  Students and staff alike make Holmes feel like the star he is!  ""The pie challenge on October 17th is something we called 'Whipping Childhood Cancer' in order to raise awareness and send love to Amber and the Rhodes Family, as well as raise money for Make a Wish, one of Amber's favorite charities.    ""Amber's brother Garrett challenged us with this earlier this year and we of course accepted and paid it forward to 7 others, helping to raise money for the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation.  We were ready for more pies and excitement...Holmes was especially looking forward to it!""  To follow up, a group of BHS teachers have organized  ""Rent-a- Student"" to help raise money for Holmes Team to cover mounting medical bills. The registration page is located at bit.ly/rent-a-student-2014.  Holmes also has a facebook page that many in our county are already following that keeps people up to date on how things are going and of events planned.  www.facebook.com/groups/holmesteam    Honestly, we have been humbled by the love, and he Holmes Team motto is ""Love Heals.""

This is the amazing story of two Ethiopian marathon runners  Sintayehi Legese Yinesu (28) and Meseret Mengistu Biru (26)  who each pocketed R100 000 after respectively clinching victory in the mens and womens categories of the 42,2km race of the new-look Soweto Marathon on Sunday.  Yinesu finished the race in 2 hours 17 minutes, while Biru made it in 2 hours 36 minutes.  The sensational way in which the duo cruised to victory was all the marathon needed to relaunch itself after it was briefly put off course by internal wrangling in Athletics South Africa.  The 2012 champion, Shadrack Kemboi of Kenya, also took part but failed to place in the top three positions, such was the intensity of the competition.  The Soweto Marathon is back with a bang, elated Soweto Marathon Director and Organiser Banele Sindane exclaimed. And its here to stay. Our aim is to grow the race so it can be counted among the best in the world. Already, the race has made a name for itself.  Earlier  at 6am to be exact  there was a sense of anticipation and excitement as Johannesburg Executive Mayor Mpho Parks Tau signalled the start of the marathon at the Nasrec Exhibition Centre outside Soweto.  Gauteng Premier David Makhura was one of the celebrities at the starting point to take part in the marathon.  More than 20 000 runners took part in this years marathon, which was divided into three: 42,2km race, 21,1km race and 10km race.  The weather, which can be a spoil sport sometimes, also did not disappoint. It was a mild and glorious day, perfect for running.  Yinesu and Biru were not the only foreigners who dominated the marathon. In the main mens race, Lesotho nationals Tebogo Sello and Motlokoa Nkhabutlane took second and third positions respectively. In the womens main race, it was Isabella Jepchumba of Kenya who came second.  But South Africans were not to be completely outdone. Joel Moni gallantly clinched victory in the 21,1km mens race, while Xoliswa Ntshali came second. The womens version of the race was won by Mapaseka Makhanya.  Both Galant and Makhanya won R10 000 each for their remarkable efforts.  Desmond Mokgobu outran and outpaced his challengers to win the 10km mens race, pocketing R5 000 in prize-money in the process. Lebogang won the womens race and also received R5 000 for her efforts.  Johannesburgs municipal-owned entities such as JMPD and the Emergency Management Services were on hand to make the marathon an incident-free and memorable event.  Mayor Tau fully supports the marathon as it eloquently speaks to the Citys Healthy Lifestyle Programme, which encourages Johannesburg residents to engage in physical activities such as running, walking and cycling to improve their health and enhance the citys life expectancy.

It's been a couple of years since I last visited Yosemite, and after spending the last year based in Shanghai I was champing at the bit to get back out into one of my favourite locations on the West Coast of America.  I suppose the combination of excitement and jetlag were to blame for me getting very little sleep the night before (with the long drive to and from Lake Tahoe the day before not taking it's toll as I expected it to either).  After heading out the door of my hotel in Sunnyvale around 5am, I was entering the boundary of Yosemite around 9am, too late for sunrise but early enough to beat the main flock of tourists who would decend on the park in the hours which followed.  I was rather disappointed to learn that the Glacier Point road had been closed overnight due to recent snowfall, after it being opened for around a week before my visit.  My plan of shooting half dome and it's buddies with snow caps on from Glacier Point was scuppered, so instead I made the most of my time wandering around the meadows of the valley floor, enjoying the ever-awesome view from ""tunnel view"" and the majestic scenery surrounding Mirror Lake.  You can bet your bottom dollar that I'll be back to Yosemite as soon as I possibly can be to hopefully capture some snow caps from Glacier Point (and head up to Tenaya Lake) before the park fully embraces the summer months ahead."

Really stoked to go again for the third year in a row. I'll post more NYC Popfest excitement as we get closer. The CiTR Fundrive finale @ the Chapel was super fun as well. I DJ'ed for the first time and though it was a short set I got to play my favourite tracks - a good dose of the Radio Dept., Air France, Memoryhouse and even an Alpaca Sports track dedicated to Madrid Popfest - because that's where I would've been.

The iconic Flame arrived at Knowsley Safari Park to be welcomed by around 6,000  people at a free event for the community.   It was carried in by local teenager Claudia Dowdeswell and passed onto the next Torch bearer, Jane Campbell who completed the circuit of the Park.  The Torch bearers were surrounded by officers from the Metropolitan Police whose duty it is to protect the Flame throughout the national Relay.  Mike Dooling, whod been a teacher in Knowsley for 40 years, brought the Torch hed carried a few days before on the Relay in Tatton Park.   Crowds gathered around him to see the Torch and many got the chance to hold it, including Knowsley Mayor and Mayoress Cllr Norman and Wendy Hogg.  Around forty different community groups were also represented with stalls and stands and local people performed at the Parks Moment to Shine stage.  To cheers and flag waving, the Torch convoy then moved onto Liverpool Road where the Relay began again.  It was carried through Huyton and out into Liverpool, cheered on by crowds, ten deep in places, whod turned out to be part of the Olympic excitement.  One of the torchbearers was 16 year old Joe Shaw, from Kirkby, who was chosen because of his charity work for the disabled and the wider community.  This was a great day for Knowsley, said Cllr Eddie Connor, Knowsleys cabinet member for Leisure, Community and Culture.  It was so exciting and great to see so many people turning out to be a part of it. They were all cheering and waving flags. It was really something.  The Torch Relay has made it possible for the whole of Britain to share in the spirit of the Games.

We lined up side-by-side, many people thought we were with a newspaper or that we knew something really amazing was just about to take place and they asked what it was and wanted to watch too. I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over. I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol. I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.   Some of the photos might seem a bit strange with the movement/blur but I find them artistic and you can find some interesting pictures within a photo when you let yourself just look without expectations. You may also notice the odd clear face/s that paused in all the movement & excitement. All in all, everyone was having a fantastic time!!

Cannibaldubbed the King of Horror Burlesquereturns one more time to present THE THIRTEENTH AND FINAL CHAPTER in his gruesome banquet of midnight mayhem!   After 7 long years of silence local cult band Reverend Glasseye returns as a shaken and somber beast to kick off this frightful night of fun! Emerging in the 90s as one of the originators of the East coast's dark cabaret movement, the band solidified its place on the scene with its junk aesthetic and operatic bravadocombining American and East European folk music to eventually win Boston's Rock and Roll Rumble in 2005. Now Reverend Glasseye finally slouches again toward Bostonand with a return to its folk roots, the band has created a sound that is leaner and darker than ever! Following their set will be a bevy of grotesque burlesque courtesy of the infamous horror troupe, Black Cat Burlesque. Dedicated to putting the BUMP back into the night, Black Cat Burlesque has been raising pulses, the dead and a whole lot of hell since 2003. As the bad seeds of Boston Burlesque, this scream team mines the depths of their twisted psychesblending striptease thrills and spookshow chills to push the boundaries of the art form and explore the dark, cobwebbed corners of neo-cabaret.  For the nights feature, Mr. Cannibal has hand-picked Peter Jackson's perversely comic BAD TASTE, screening on 35 mm film! Driven by a wild combination of extreme gore, horror, and comedy: this seminal cult classic is an often forgotten classic from one of the world's most popular contemporary film makers. You definitely want to catch this one on the big screen!  Free gory goodie bags will be handed out to all, and J. Cannibal will award a number of prizes for the best zombie costumes.  Brought to you by the creative minds of Black Ocean, this will be a show of insanity from beyond the grave that you dont want to miss!

Cannibal, is a celebration of all things terrifying. The Improper Bostonian Think Rocky Horror Picture Show with less androgyny and more anthropophagy.

It's been a couple of years since I last visited Yosemite, and after spending the last year based in Shanghai I was champing at the bit to get back out into one of my favourite locations on the West Coast of America.  I suppose the combination of excitement and jetlag were to blame for me getting very little sleep the night before (with the long drive to and from Lake Tahoe the day before not taking it's toll as I expected it to either).  After heading out the door of my hotel in Sunnyvale around 5am, I was entering the boundary of Yosemite around 9am, too late for sunrise but early enough to beat the main flock of tourists who would decend on the park in the hours which followed.  I was rather disappointed to learn that the Glacier Point road had been closed overnight due to recent snowfall, after it being opened for around a week before my visit.  My plan of shooting half dome and it's buddies with snow caps on from Glacier Point was scuppered, so instead I made the most of my time wandering around the meadows of the valley floor, enjoying the ever-awesome view from ""tunnel view"" and the majestic scenery surrounding Mirror Lake.  You can bet your bottom dollar that I'll be back to Yosemite as soon as I possibly can be to hopefully capture some snow caps from Glacier Point (and head up to Tenaya Lake) before the park fully embraces the summer months ahead."

It was very exciting to have all of our Willows family members join us for our visiting day. We are so glad that so many parents and grandparents shared in the fun.  While the temperature outside continued to rise, so did all the excitement. With the extremely hot weather, we changed our schedule to include more indoor activities. This helped both the campers and counselors stay as cool as possible. Of course, we added additional swim periods and encouraged lots of water breaks to help everyone beat the heat.  On Tuesday we had a surprise visit from the Glee Club who performed two fabulous songs. The Willows really had fun singing a repeat after me song with them. Uncle Teek, from security, also joined us for a delicious lunch the same day.  This weeks theme was Under the Sea. The Tadpoles and Minnows painted and decorated Goldfish Sun Catchers. In Ceramics, the campers enjoyed painting their clay hands and feet. All your childrens projects will be sent home shortly.   Picture day for The Willows was a huge success as the campers and staff had big smiles on their faces. Your copy will be sent home at the end of the summer.  The week ended with The Willows campers joining the main camp at Waterworld. They drove water boats, enjoyed climbing on the floats and sliding into a counselors arms. A terrific time was had by all!! Pictures of this wonderful event will be posted early next week.  We are looking forward to the next four weeks with. As a reminder, please remember to label all items brought to camp and wear yellow as often as possible.  About Willow Grove Day Camp Willow Grove Day Camp provides summer fun for kids who live in Willow Grove, Abington, Blue Bell, Hatboro, Horsham, Huntingdon Valley, Lafayette Hill, Philadelphia, Plymouth Meeting, Southampton and the surrounding areas.

Despite snowy weather, families and friends arrived throughout the morning to enjoy an all-you-can-eat pancake breakfast with their loved ones.  There was a bake sale, operated by resident volunteers.  The variety of baked goods were sold and all monies went to the Resident Activities fund, to be used for special events and outings throughout the year.  There were also private vendors selling their wares, providing for some convenient holiday shopping.  Of course, the moment everyone was waiting for was the arrival of Santa. As the snow fell and the wind blew, some showed concern that Santa might not make it, but right on time, the doors opened and there stood Santa.  A wave of excitement and applause went through the crowd as Santa made his way to his chair next to the large Christmas tree.  ""Now this is my kinda weather!"" he shouted to the crowd as the children lined up.  Once the children finished telling Santa what they wanted, residents made their way to Santa's lap as well.  Staff and families soon followed suit as everyone wanted their picture with Santa.   Before Santa left, he drew a boy's name and a girl's name from the basket. Each child was given a FREE raffle ticket.  There were 2 giant baskets filled with toys and treats for the lucky boy and girl whose names were called. As the party came to a close, the winners were announced and the happy children collected their prizes.  There was also an adult raffle for a wine basket.  Tickets were $1.00 each and the money raised also went to the Resident Activity fund. ""I was worried that the weather would ruin the party.""

If your senses are dulled so as to avoid excitement I hope that you still feel the rise of a pleasure at the reception of myth made flesh amongst the throng of life on the High Street.  With just a touch of theatre and a presence of performance dreams can flicker into reality, through a break in the crowd they can begin to take form.  Sometimes we are fortunate enough to have a small imp filled painting box with which to record the light fall and the shadow up play.

There is so much going on and so much excitement in our vibrant city it's hard to say where to start.  The first thing one must know about Victoria is its Inner Harbour; it is the heart of the city and one of the world's most beautiful sea-going harbours. So let's start our day here.   The harbour is flanked on three sides by the British Columbia Legislative Buildings (Parliament Buildings) on its south; the Fairmont Empress Hotel to the east and Victoria Visitors Bureau to the north. The western reach enters into the Outer Habour  and the Strait of Juan de Fuca, which in turn joins to the Pacific Ocean.  The Royal BC Museum (RBCM) is situated between the Parliament Buildings and the Empress Hotel. This where the mainstage was for the bulk of the Aboriginal Festival events.   In this Live Streaming Victoria Inner Harbour Cam frame, one can see the Empress Hotel at the righthand side of the frame and the Visitos Infromation Centre beyond on the other side of the harbour.   We saw and met a couple of familiar faces here: one being George Taylor and the other Aaron Murray. George is leader and  performer with his two sons in their La La Dance Troupe and Performers and Aaron is well known around town for his musical skill playing the mandolin or guitar. This day Aaron was on mandolin backing Art Napoleon, singer/songwriter of the Cree Nation.  After we left there we walked up to the Greater Victoria Public Library (GVPL) to enjoy the World Refugee Day Celebrations; this included meeting Dr. Hugh Johnston and his wife seated at their vendor table in the shade at the library square. Hugh was to give a reading from his book The Voyage of the Komagata Maru: The Sikh Challenge to Canada's Colour Bar but we simply bought the book and left.   While we were chatting  with Hugh, he signed my copy of Jewels of the Qila and his latest book we just purchased. I gave him a few pages of hardcopy notes I formulated after reading (making a profound study of?) his earlier publication:  Jewels of the Qila. When I told him he could read them on the ferry on his way home to Vancouver he said:  ""Oh, you think it will be safe by then to read it once I'm on the ferry?""  The man still has a sense of humor!  We still had one more stop to make: The legion to meet our friends and join them for supper at Gorge Road Pub. We stopped in at the legion and saw the old gang we've missed the past three weeks due to other commitments. Good to see C+H and S+C again -- but still no TopHats!                      "

For most of the first half of the 20th century, if you talked about stop-motion animation, you were basically talking about Willis OBrien. OBrien wasnt the only one using the technique, of course, but the most famous of the old movies employing it were his work. OBrien was the man behind King Kong, The Son of Kong, and the 1925 version of The Lost World (and for that matter, he also worked on the latter films 1960 remake), along with several other mostly forgotten movies going all the way back to 1915. But while OBrien would continue to work in the special effects field throughout the 1950s, he had by that time been eclipsed by a new alpha-male in the stop-motion pack-- the legendary Ray Harryhausen. What gives Mighty Joe Young significance all out of proportion to its overall merits is the fact that it is the only movie on which both OBrien and Harryhausen collaborated on the effects work. Mighty Joe Young is also the final installment in what might loosely be called the RKO Monkey Trilogy, the three films about oversized gorillas directed by Ernest B. Schoedsack and produced by Merian C. Cooper. (The previous two films were, of course, King Kong and The Son of Kong.) And while it is by no means up to the standard set by the original Kong, it is at least vastly superior to that movies embarrassing cheap-jack sequel.    In the simplest terms, this is a fable about a girl and her pet gorilla, and as with all fables, you can rest assured that there will be a moral involved at some point. Our story begins in Africa, where six- or seven-year-old Jill Young (Lora Lee Michel for the moment, but for most of the movie, shell be played by Terry Moore, who came from Son of Lassie and who, after some 20 years of respectability, would be reduced to Black Eliminator and Hellhole) gets it into her head one day to trade a few of her toys and her fathers heavy-duty flashlight (the kind cops use to beat you up with) for a baby gorilla that a pair of local hunters have captured. Her plantation-owner father (Regis Toomey, from One Frightened Night and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea), I hasten to add, knows nothing of this transaction until he arrives home from wherever it is that white plantation owners in sub-Saharan Africa go during the day, and finds said gorilla in Jills bed. As he says to Jill when she asks if hes mad at her, he takes the situation rather well for a man who has learned that his daughter has just acquired a pet ape. But that does not mean Jill is allowed to keep the beast-- a father has to draw the line somewhere, right?      It appears, however, that Mr. Young ought to have used something more along the lines of those huge, smelly markers the kids use to tag the stalls of public toilets to accomplish his line-drawing, because the very next shot has Jill feeding her gorilla (whom she has named Joe) from a baby bottle, while her father looks on bemusedly, feebly trying to reassert his authority to keep his home free from 800-pound apes. But it does no good, of course, and when the screen fills with the image of the Brooklyn Bridge and the legend: New York, 12 years later, we know without having to be told that Jill still has her unorthodox pet. So what are we doing on the opposite side of the Atlantic from Jill, her father, and Joe? Why, were looking in on the activities of a certain nightclub proprietor by the name of Max OHara (Robert Armstrong, from King Kong and its sequel). OHara has just decided to spread his wings a bit, and open a new club on the West Coast-- in Hollywood, to be exact. Because of the inherently risky nature of this venture, he wants to make sure that he makes a strong initial showing, and he has come up with what he regards as a fool-proof angle for the new night spot. Riding the wave of public fascination with exotic locales that was then giving rise to the tiki bar, OHara plans to give his L.A. club an African theme, and to that end, he has arranged to go on a safari for the purposes of capturing live African animals to give the whole affair the strongest possible air of authenticity. Obviously, one does not attempt to do such a thing alone, and OHara hires an Oklahoma cowboy named Gregg (Ben Johnson, who after a long and presumably rewarding career making westerns ended up providing low-cost name recognition to such films as The Deadly Bees, The Town that Dreaded Sundown, and Cherry 2000), along with all of his Oklahoma cowboy buddies, to conduct the actual capture of the necessary beasts. Who would ever have thought that you could rope a lion the way you do a steer?     But thats just what Gregg and his men do, until they find themselves fact to face with an altogether more challenging quarry, a huge, stop-motion gorilla. The fact that this is a stop-motion gorilla should tell you a thing or two, as should the exclamation on the part of OHaras safari guide that gorilla territory is hundreds of miles away. Our expectations are confirmed a few minutes later, when a young woman appears and orders the gorilla (who had been winning the struggle against the cowboys, hands down) to cease and desist. The woman-- the now-grown-up Jill Young-- then launches into Gregg, OHara, and the cowboys, demanding to know what in the hell they think theyre doing trespassing on her land and attacking her pet ape. OHara and his associates, understandably flummoxed, have no answer capable of satisfying Jill, and they are left standing around looking like fools when the girl storms off into the bush with her gorilla. But OHara is not a man to remain stymied for long, and it soon crosses his mind that Jill and Joe are exactly what his L.A. nightclub needs to make the sort of splash OHara seeks. He sends Gregg to the Young family plantation (which Jill has been running by herself since the death of her father some six months before) to apologize for the misunderstanding and to try to get her interested in listening to OHaras pitch.    Gregg succeeds, and OHara springs into action. He promises her fame, fortune, excitement, a swank new wardrobe-- pretty much everything that a certain other Robert Armstrong character once promised a similar nave young woman, in fact. And like that other woman, Jill falls for it, hook, line, and sinker. Within days, she, Joe, and Gregg are in L.A., working for OHara. The new club is just as garish and tacky and hideous as you might imagine, all caged lions, bamboo walls, and African masks. And then theres the floor show, which features black dancers dressed as African tribal warriors and musicians playing traditional African rhythm instruments. But the main attraction, of course, is Mr. Joseph Young, of Africa. The gorilla makes his big entrance after an introductory speech from OHara, rising from a pit in the center of the stage to hold aloft a grand piano on which Jill plays Beautiful Dreamer, the song to which she used to put him to sleep as an infant. OHaras crowd is duly impressed, and the promoter assures Jill that her contract will be good for a long, long time.    Of course, thats pretty much the exact opposite of what Jill wanted to hear. It doesnt take long before the novelty of being a novelty act wears thin for her, and it wears thin for Joe even faster. The fact that OHara has Jill and her gorilla perform ever more exploitative and demeaning acts as the weeks wear on (Tenth Mammoth Week! the sign on the front of the club trumpets) doesnt exactly help the situation, either, and it is during the Tenth Mammoth Week that Jill goes to her employer (with Gregg along for moral support) to announce that she and Joe are going back to Africa. OHara is predictably dismayed, but he acquiesces, on the condition that Jill allow him some time to find a replacement act. That seems fair enough to Jill.    But seven weeks later (17th Colossal Week!), theres no sign of any replacement, and Jill is fed up. The show that night is particularly unsavory, involving the audience getting to throw enormous coins at the stage for Joe to try to catch in a commensurately enormous cup, and it gets out of hand when one drunk patron decides it would be funny to throw a bottle at the ape instead. Jill immediately stops the show, returns Joe to his cage in the basement, and goes to talk to OHara again. Meanwhile, the offending drunk and his friends sneak downstairs to ply Joe with wine. I guess it seemed funny at the time, but the three men stop laughing when the inebriated Joe smashes out of his cage and destroys the club, relenting only when Jill, OHara, and Gregg arrive to bring him under control. Of course, the police arrive too, and they take a rather dim view of rampaging apes.    So, for that matter, does the city of Los Angeles, which secures a court order for Joes destruction. Faced with such an incredibly ugly situation, and with the certain knowledge that its all his fault, OHara goes to Jill with a plan to sneak her and Joe back home to Africa. The rest of the film sees this plan put into action, with an array of blunders and strokes of bad luck to add some suspense, and concludes by giving Joe an unexpected opportunity to redeem himself in the eyes of the law.     Basically, what weve got here is an old-fashioned family movie. Its fundamentally escapist and unthreatening, but its not so cloyingly juvenile as to be unendurable for an adult audience. And because it was made in the late 1940s-- a time when adults were still willing to credit children with a certain amount of resilience in the face of tragedy, before suitable for children was taken to mean unrelentingly, mindlessly upbeat-- there is up until the very end a legitimate question regarding how it will all turn out. When movies like this are made today, a happy ending is a foregone conclusion. Here, though, there is no such easy assurance, even if everything working out in the end seems to be the likeliest outcome. This genuine uncertainty is Mighty Joe Youngs greatest strength, and makes it easier to look beyond its essential silliness and sappiness to find a surprisingly good-- if childish-- film.  "

This is the amazing story of two Ethiopian marathon runners  Sintayehi Legese Yinesu (28) and Meseret Mengistu Biru (26)  who each pocketed R100 000 after respectively clinching victory in the mens and womens categories of the 42,2km race of the new-look Soweto Marathon on Sunday.  Yinesu finished the race in 2 hours 17 minutes, while Biru made it in 2 hours 36 minutes.  The sensational way in which the duo cruised to victory was all the marathon needed to relaunch itself after it was briefly put off course by internal wrangling in Athletics South Africa.  The 2012 champion, Shadrack Kemboi of Kenya, also took part but failed to place in the top three positions, such was the intensity of the competition.  The Soweto Marathon is back with a bang, elated Soweto Marathon Director and Organiser Banele Sindane exclaimed. And its here to stay. Our aim is to grow the race so it can be counted among the best in the world. Already, the race has made a name for itself.  Earlier  at 6am to be exact  there was a sense of anticipation and excitement as Johannesburg Executive Mayor Mpho Parks Tau signalled the start of the marathon at the Nasrec Exhibition Centre outside Soweto.  Gauteng Premier David Makhura was one of the celebrities at the starting point to take part in the marathon.  More than 20 000 runners took part in this years marathon, which was divided into three: 42,2km race, 21,1km race and 10km race.  The weather, which can be a spoil sport sometimes, also did not disappoint. It was a mild and glorious day, perfect for running.  Yinesu and Biru were not the only foreigners who dominated the marathon. In the main mens race, Lesotho nationals Tebogo Sello and Motlokoa Nkhabutlane took second and third positions respectively. In the womens main race, it was Isabella Jepchumba of Kenya who came second.  But South Africans were not to be completely outdone. Joel Moni gallantly clinched victory in the 21,1km mens race, while Xoliswa Ntshali came second. The womens version of the race was won by Mapaseka Makhanya.  Both Galant and Makhanya won R10 000 each for their remarkable efforts.  Desmond Mokgobu outran and outpaced his challengers to win the 10km mens race, pocketing R5 000 in prize-money in the process. Lebogang won the womens race and also received R5 000 for her efforts.  Johannesburgs municipal-owned entities such as JMPD and the Emergency Management Services were on hand to make the marathon an incident-free and memorable event.  Mayor Tau fully supports the marathon as it eloquently speaks to the Citys Healthy Lifestyle Programme, which encourages Johannesburg residents to engage in physical activities such as running, walking and cycling to improve their health and enhance the citys life expectancy.

Cannibaldubbed the King of Horror Burlesquereturns one more time to present THE THIRTEENTH AND FINAL CHAPTER in his gruesome banquet of midnight mayhem!   After 7 long years of silence local cult band Reverend Glasseye returns as a shaken and somber beast to kick off this frightful night of fun! Emerging in the 90s as one of the originators of the East coast's dark cabaret movement, the band solidified its place on the scene with its junk aesthetic and operatic bravadocombining American and East European folk music to eventually win Boston's Rock and Roll Rumble in 2005. Now Reverend Glasseye finally slouches again toward Bostonand with a return to its folk roots, the band has created a sound that is leaner and darker than ever! Following their set will be a bevy of grotesque burlesque courtesy of the infamous horror troupe, Black Cat Burlesque. Dedicated to putting the BUMP back into the night, Black Cat Burlesque has been raising pulses, the dead and a whole lot of hell since 2003. As the bad seeds of Boston Burlesque, this scream team mines the depths of their twisted psychesblending striptease thrills and spookshow chills to push the boundaries of the art form and explore the dark, cobwebbed corners of neo-cabaret.  For the nights feature, Mr. Cannibal has hand-picked Peter Jackson's perversely comic BAD TASTE, screening on 35 mm film! Driven by a wild combination of extreme gore, horror, and comedy: this seminal cult classic is an often forgotten classic from one of the world's most popular contemporary film makers. You definitely want to catch this one on the big screen!  Free gory goodie bags will be handed out to all, and J. Cannibal will award a number of prizes for the best zombie costumes.  Brought to you by the creative minds of Black Ocean, this will be a show of insanity from beyond the grave that you dont want to miss! With hundreds of fiends showing up to each Feast of Flesh over the past ten years, come see what the excitement is about for yourself!  A thick slab of praise for J. Cannibal and his Feast of Flesh: J. Cannibal, the King of Horror Burlesque. Boston's Weekly Dig J. Cannibal's Feast of Flesh, led by real-life undertaker and zombie lover J. Cannibal, is a celebration of all things terrifying. The Improper Bostonian Think Rocky Horror Picture Show with less androgyny and more anthropophagy. The Onion  [J.Cannibal] is the sort of guy people brag about knowing. After all, he sounds like an exotic, epic character: poet, undertaker, horror-burlesque king, small-press publisher, show promoter, fake-blood engineer. The Boston Phoenix "

It was very exciting to have all of our Willows family members join us for our visiting day. We are so glad that so many parents and grandparents shared in the fun.  While the temperature outside continued to rise, so did all the excitement. With the extremely hot weather, we changed our schedule to include more indoor activities. This helped both the campers and counselors stay as cool as possible. Of course, we added additional swim periods and encouraged lots of water breaks to help everyone beat the heat.  On Tuesday we had a surprise visit from the Glee Club who performed two fabulous songs. The Willows really had fun singing a repeat after me song with them. Uncle Teek, from security, also joined us for a delicious lunch the same day.  This weeks theme was Under the Sea. The Tadpoles and Minnows painted and decorated Goldfish Sun Catchers. In Ceramics, the campers enjoyed painting their clay hands and feet. All your childrens projects will be sent home shortly.   Picture day for The Willows was a huge success as the campers and staff had big smiles on their faces. Your copy will be sent home at the end of the summer.  The week ended with The Willows campers joining the main camp at Waterworld. They drove water boats, enjoyed climbing on the floats and sliding into a counselors arms. A terrific time was had by all!! Pictures of this wonderful event will be posted early next week.  We are looking forward to the next four weeks with. As a reminder, please remember to label all items brought to camp and wear yellow as often as possible.

You had a great time hanging out with Grandma and Grandpa. Unfortunately all the excitement really messed up your sleep and combined with some teething, nights have been hard around here. It's ok though. Soon those teeth will come in and your sleep schedule will get back on track. It's just hard to see you exhausted and in pain. You loved seeing the ocean and feeling the sand between your toes. We also learned that the saying, ""Garbage In, Garbage Out"" is so very true with you and your diet. Since we were traveling, I used commercial baby food for your meals and the result was terrible. As soon as we got home and back on your homemade baby food, you were happier and so were your diapers (and that is as detailed as I'll get). You are an excellent car traveler. You play with your toys, ask for food periodically and look out the window, but mainly you sleep. You are fantastic at entertaining yourself in the backseat and so far, neither one of us have had to ride with you in the backseat. It's been a busy and fun week. Now we are settling back into our routine which is always nice. You also learned how to ""clappy-clappy"" and wave like the Queen this week. You have spent a lot of time practicing those skills along with crusing the furniture and standing up ALL THE TIME. You are deeply in love with standing. This has led to many moments where you stand in your crib and yell at us. Oh the fun times! "

I spent NYE on Granville St in Vancouver BC with two other fantastic photographers capturing the fun of the evening. We lined up side-by-side, many people thought we were with a newspaper or that we knew something really amazing was just about to take place and they asked what it was and wanted to watch too. I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over. I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol. I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.   Some of the photos might seem a bit strange with the movement/blur but I find them artistic and you can find some interesting pictures within a photo when you let yourself just look without expectations. You may also notice the odd clear face/s that paused in all the movement & excitement. All in all, everyone was having a fantastic time!!

I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over. I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol. I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.   Some of the photos might seem a bit strange with the movement/blur but I find them artistic and you can find some interesting pictures within a photo when you let yourself just look without expectations. You may also notice the odd clear face/s that paused in all the movement & excitement. All in all, everyone was having a fantastic time!!  If you see yourself in any of the pictures on my Facebook page, please tag yourself and then share the photos to your friends & family. If you like my page then you will get notified for when I post the rest of the pictures which are coming soon! www.facebook.com/AnnaHallPhotographer  Thank YOU for posing for me and bringing such great energy to NYE!!"

We also have another 10 acres for additional parking for the very large events. The track is 1900km long and is a minimum of 10 metres wide with some sections 15 metres wide and sits in a valley with trees on one side.

All this with superb viewing for specatators.   Whilst the track is fast and flowing, its a very technical track, with some old-school features such as adverse cambers and natural terrain, combined with some man-made jumps, along with a rythm section to add to the excitement for riders and spectators alike.

This is the amazing story of two Ethiopian marathon runners  Sintayehi Legese Yinesu (28) and Meseret Mengistu Biru (26)  who each pocketed R100 000 after respectively clinching victory in the mens and womens categories of the 42,2km race of the new-look Soweto Marathon on Sunday.  Yinesu finished the race in 2 hours 17 minutes, while Biru made it in 2 hours 36 minutes.  The sensational way in which the duo cruised to victory was all the marathon needed to relaunch itself after it was briefly put off course by internal wrangling in Athletics South Africa.  The 2012 champion, Shadrack Kemboi of Kenya, also took part but failed to place in the top three positions, such was the intensity of the competition.  The Soweto Marathon is back with a bang, elated Soweto Marathon Director and Organiser Banele Sindane exclaimed. And its here to stay. Our aim is to grow the race so it can be counted among the best in the world. Already, the race has made a name for itself.  Earlier  at 6am to be exact  there was a sense of anticipation and excitement as Johannesburg Executive Mayor Mpho Parks Tau signalled the start of the marathon at the Nasrec Exhibition Centre outside Soweto.  Gauteng Premier David Makhura was one of the celebrities at the starting point to take part in the marathon.  More than 20 000 runners took part in this years marathon, which was divided into three: 42,2km race, 21,1km race and 10km race.  The weather, which can be a spoil sport sometimes, also did not disappoint. It was a mild and glorious day, perfect for running.  Yinesu and Biru were not the only foreigners who dominated the marathon. In the main mens race, Lesotho nationals Tebogo Sello and Motlokoa Nkhabutlane took second and third positions respectively. In the womens main race, it was Isabella Jepchumba of Kenya who came second.  But South Africans were not to be completely outdone. Joel Moni gallantly clinched victory in the 21,1km mens race, while Xoliswa Ntshali came second. The womens version of the race was won by Mapaseka Makhanya.  Both Galant and Makhanya won R10 000 each for their remarkable efforts.  Desmond Mokgobu outran and outpaced his challengers to win the 10km mens race, pocketing R5 000 in prize-money in the process. Lebogang won the womens race and also received R5 000 for her efforts.  Johannesburgs municipal-owned entities such as JMPD and the Emergency Management Services were on hand to make the marathon an incident-free and memorable event.  Mayor Tau fully supports the marathon as it eloquently speaks to the Citys Healthy Lifestyle Programme, which encourages Johannesburg residents to engage in physical activities such as running, walking and cycling to improve their health and enhance the citys life expectancy.  Sponsors such as Nike, Nedbank, Coca-Cola and the National Lottery contributed to the success of this years edition of the marathon.
