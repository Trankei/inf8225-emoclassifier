The march was organised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions but included many with no union affiliations looking for an outlet to vent their anger at the present government.   The route went from Wood Quay to the GPO in O'Connell Street where a series of speeches were held. The atmosphere along the route was peaceful and family-friendly. After the main speeches, Joe Higgins MEP and Richard Boyd-Barrett from a new grouping called the United Left Alliance, addressed the crowds from underneath the O'Connell monument.   Following the main march, a small group of protesters marched to the Dail (Irish Parliament) where they set fire to a poster of Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Brian Cowen. A heavy Garda (Irish Police) presence ensured that this later demonstration passed off without major incident. "

Brenntag rejected accusations of negligence on Friday 13th January after a report it could face legal action over its role as silicone supplier to PIP, and has claimed the bulk silicone-gel it provided was clearly marked as unsuitable for use in implants.   The French government has advised the 30,000 women in France who have the implants to have them removed due to concerns they might rupture. Governments in several other countries, such as Britain and Brazil, have asked women to visit their doctors for checks, but as yet the NHS in Britain is not offering to remove the PiP implants, despite the risk of rupture and health risks caused by leaking silicone.  A French investigating judge visited PIP offices earlier in January as part of a probe into the death of a woman from cancer, which could lead to charges of involuntary homicide against the firm. French authorities ordered the company to withdraw its breast implants from the market in March 2010.  The average cost of a breast-augmentation proceedure from The Harley Medical Group is, like most of the very profitable high-end cosmetic surgery companies in and around Harley Street, somewhere in the region of 4,500 ( 5,450), and if this is accurate then Harley Street Medical has made somewhere in the region of 58.5 million ( 70.8 million) from fitting toxic PiP implants. The company issued a statement this week claiming that if they replaced the sub-standard implants for free they would go out of business, and the responsibility should fall on the NHS or PiP - who manufactured the lower-priced implants - to clean up the mess, but the demonstrators are angrily demanding that the private clinics foot the bill.   Several women at the protest still have leaking PiP implants in their breasts and are suffering a wide range of serious symptoms, but cannot afford to pay the same cosmetic surgeon to remove them, let alone replace them. This kind of luxury surgery is a once-in-a-lifetime purchase fore many women, and they are angered that their lives have been put at risk by cost-cutting, and that the culprits are attempting to walk away from the whole matter, leaving the UK taxpayer to foot the bill.  PIP implants were banned in France in 2010, with the French government advising 30,000 women to have their implants removed, but thus far the British government has offered very limited help to British patients, choosing instead to broadcast a public information video on national TV networks this weekend downplaying the risks, with Secretary of State for Health Andrew Lansley saying in press briefings that he expects private medical companies who have fitted the French implants to ""step up to their responsibilities"".

They have swooped in like vultures, highlighting their plans at a so called public exhibition with only 2 days notice. Over 300 people turned out to object (very loudly) to this totally inappropriate development within our community which is neither wanted or needed They say they will be building affordable homes, at what cost you may ask, well let's start at 300,000.00. That should earn them a tidy profit. They say they will make our schools better, how much better can they make them, we are already in the top 10%. They say the land does not suffer any flooding, perhaps they would like to tell that to the ducks, birds and wildlife that go there. They say they are going to build here whether we like it or not. They say there is no problem. We Say FRAGOFF!  On Friday 17th August 2012, we held a public meeting where over 400 people attended to show their support and anger at their proposals. Thus our action group was formed, Formby Residents Action Group, Opposition From Formby (F.R.A.G.O.F.F.). Surely the council can have no doubt how the community feel about this issue.  The Government say building houses will boost our economic growth. How is that? What we need is Jobs, Export and Industry. If there are no jobs then who will buy these houses, banks are not lending, people cant afford them and developers cant sell the houses they already have empty. Why build then you may ask. A good question as THIS IS ALL ABOUT MONEY, MONEY FOR THE DEVELOPERS, VAST PROFITS AT THE EXPENSE OF COMMUNTIES, RIDING ROUGH SHOD OVER THE LOCAL COMMUNITY AND LINING THEIR OWN POCKETS, NOT TO MENTION A FEW MORE ON THE WAY TO GET WHAT THEY WANT.  You may ask why we think this, maybe it is because this piece of beautiful land has a value to them of 120,000,000. What do you think they would do to ensure they had this piece of land to build on? Who would they upset on the way to achieve their profit? US OF COURSE. What about the rest of our green belt land, are we going to join up with Hightown, Ince Blundell, Ainsdale?  What is going to happen to our countryside, will we all end up living in concrete land, surrounded by development. Where will the developers stop, we dont think they will, not until every inch of green land is built on. They have the money to help them get the answer they want to hear, go on BUILD, BUILD, BUILD until you can build no more, dont worry about the people, they dont matter. They are just a minor detail that can be hoodwinked, lied to, told what they want to hear and will sit back and take it until it is all to late. Well we wont sit back anymore, we wont be hoodwinked by all the spin and we will fight and come together as a country and say ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. We are fighting for all the children of the future, what future will they have when there is no green land anymore, all the farms have sold to the developers and we cant grow any food, we will import it of course from other countries who have kept their land, but at what cost.  STOP BUILDING ON GREEN BELT NOW."

This officer and his colleagues really roughed up this young female krishna protester who, like myself was swept back in the swell by riot police but unlike me, she ended up jammed between two of the parked police vans (which formed the new police line as they pulled back surrendering the RBS branch to the vandals). The officer grabbed her and, with his colleagues, shoved her into the open door of the van, shaking her and (in another of the four or five frames I shot) elbowed her in the head as she wriggled free and fled towards me... I have another shot of her taken shortly after with her bloodied ear where it appears her earing has been pulled and nearly ripped from her ear.  I wanted to post this to show something that only I witnessed.   I believe that the police strategy as a whole on the day was ill-considered and partially responsible for the the fracas that ensued. If you hem people in like animals and become heavy handed, they will respond like animals... This is not to say that there were no intentional troublemakers in the crowd (I saw plenty) but had the police maintained a much looser ring around the area, I believe the troublemakers would have had no justification to kick-off and the intended 'picnic at the bank' type protest would have been uneventful - as was the climate camp outside the climate-exchange (for the most part until the police tried to forcibly remove the campers)."

Thousands of university, college and school students  joined by workers  are marching in London and Manchester against Tory cuts to education, fee rises and attacks on jobs and services.  The revolution in Tunisia and uprising in Egypt have clearly inspired the marches. Marchers have chanted, Egypt, Egypt everywhere.  London  Aisha, an FE student from Camden in north London said, Ive been on all the demonstrations, but some of my friends are here who havent been out on the protests before.   I like the slogan This is only the beginning, because its going to be a long fight against this government.  Theo, a school student from south east London, took part in the Day X walkouts last year. He said, Lots of people who want to go to university wont be able to and people will definitely be affected by the cuts to EMA [Education Maintenance Allowance]. The government is making the wrong people pay  the bankers are getting hundreds of thousands in bonuses. For workers, the student protests have been an inspiration.  A GMB rep joining the protest in London said, Im here to show solidarity with the students. Ive got a daughter who has just gone through university and there is no way she would have been able to afford 9,000 a year fees.  Im also here to say that I dont believe in these cuts. Weve got to stick together workers and students. I think that the TUC demo on the 26 March can give people confidence to fight.  UCU lecturer Vicky Margree works at the University of Brighton. She said, We face 100 percent cut in arts and humanities funding which will hit universities hard. And the new fees will make university unaffordable for the majority of people.  Kelly Rogers, a Unison organiser, said, Unless we show solidarity with younger people we may as well give up. Students have led the way and enthused workers, showing us how to fight.  Solidarity with the Egyptian uprising  In London the mood was electric as up to a thousand students joined the many hundreds of people already protesting in solidarity with the Egyptian people outside the embassy off Park Lane.  Chants of Solidarity, solidarity, London and Cairo unite and fight and Hey ho Mubarak has to go are ringing through the air.  One man on the original protest said, I cant believe that all these young people have come to support us. This makes us feel even stronger. I cant wait to send the pictures of all you British people who have come to support us to people back home.  Before reaching the embassy, the protest stopped outside the Tory HQ at Millbank  a focus of student anger and protests last year  as students chanted, Tory scum, here we come.

But scratch beneath the surface and the haunting story behind GOLIATH blurs in and out of horrific focus, examining the ruins of an American culture obsessed with apocalyptic carnage. GOLIATH was born in the bleak wasteland where the more savage your act, the more celebrated you become - and in a world where the miserable feel obliged to retaliate, the BUTCHER BABIES shatter the dementia with molten fury and unbridled sonic bliss.   Hailing from the City Of Angels, the BUTCHER BABIES offer redemption from the overplayed underground, exorcising demons with a visceral sound matched only in scope by their explosive stage show. Frontwomen Carla Harvey and Heidi Shepherd, guitarist Henry Flury [Amen], bassist Jason Klein [Azdachao] and drummer Chris Warner [Scars of Tomorrow] juxtapose brutal, aggressive riffs with beautiful melodies that wail with anguish and hope for redemption.    The band signed a worldwide deal with Century Media Records in December 2012, and a month later hit the road with Marilyn Manson on what proved to be one of the new year's most talked about tours. The run was a return to form for Manson and a call to arms for the BUTCHER BABIES, who honed their razor-sharp riffs and soul-searing vocals in front of live audiences as a source of manic pre-production. Only days after wrapping the tour in the City Of Sin, the band was in an L.A. studio with producer Josh Wilbur [Gojira, Lamb Of God, Hatebreed] recording the debut album that has the metal community buzzing.    The eleven-track opus chronicles the story of the forsaken as they transform into GOLIATH - monsters that society has built, and monsters that turn to society for retribution. Suddenly opening track ""I Smell A Massacre"" is more than just shock rock, casting a cautionary tale to anyone in screaming distance. And once it sinks in that GOLIATH is more than just a figment of our imagination, the rest of the album becomes all the more real.   ""Magnolia Blvd"" is about the demons that coexist around us all, while ""Grim Sleeper"" is unsettling and haunting, an angelic intro quickly pulverized by a repressed memory so real we feel the victim's cries. ""In Denial"" couples blood-curdling angst with more of the melodies that showcase the BUTCHER BABIES unique, two-frontwoman lineup at its most profound - singing and screaming trading hope and rage like caged souls fighting for freedom. ""Give Me Reason"" bounces hard and fast with hell-bent fury, ""The Mirror Never Lies"" assaults our reflection with an ominous and catchy chorus, and ""The Deathsurround"" showcases the band at perhaps its most intense with a song as heavy and brutal as the title suggests.   BUTCHER BABIES celebrate the July 9 release of GOLIATH as part of the 2013 Rockstar Energy Drink Mayhem Festival, where they are a mainstay on the Jagermeister stage and spend the summer alongside heavyweights including Rob Zombie, Five Finger Death Punch, Machine Head, Mastodon and Amon Amarth.    With an unrelenting delivery and uncompromising intent to melt faces, GOLIATH is more than just a record - it is the growing enemy that angers, drives and inspires the BUTCHER BABIES. GOLIATH is our common enemy, and BUTCHER BABIES have arrived to deliver the soundtrack that will lead us into battle...   "

Work began in 1868, the building contractor being Mr. George Thomas of Orielton Terrace, Pembroke Dock. Whilst excavating the foundations deep into the rock, the ruins of a chapel were removed, together with an Egyptian effigy, bones of a human skeleton, and some Roman coins, work was finally completed in 1870, it was subsequently fortified and garrisoned but the guns were never fired in anger.  In 1907 the Island was sold privately for 500, and eventually by way of further sale, found its way into the hands of the wealthy Windsor - Richards family, who were involved in the South Wales Iron and Steel Industry. The elegance of their occupation is well remembered, with the main hall carpeted with animal skins, glass trophy cabinets, Tapestries, and many Stag heads and hunting trophies bedecking the walls. The principal rooms were furnished in period styles, with the main hall containing its huge open fireplace being a focal point for numerous lavish celebrations, in particular, the Tenby Hunt Ball.  Around 1920 the family left Tenby, and much of the furniture and decor from the Fort was sold in the Town, and is still can be found within homes in the locality. Today the Fort lies derelict, stripped of its former elegance, but steeped in character, and history."

The average American is oblivious to what is going on, yet our friend and close ally, Israel, is literally surrounded by nations that are experiencing riots and uprisings on a continually growing scale.      There is a spirit of discontent, anger, and strife operating in the Middle East that is tearing countries apart and, ultimately, it is going to turn totally toward Jerusalem. Lets just look at a word picture of current conditions in the Middle East.     In Syria, tens of thousands of people have been slaughtered as Islamic rebels have fought to depose the Assad regime. Look for it to fall under the control of an alliance of al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, and the Muslim Brotherhood, all enemies of Israel.     Turkey is coping with the tensions caused by having to deal with over 100,000 refugees who have crossed the border from Syria and are being housed in 42 different camps.      On the other side of Syria the natives are getting restless in Jordan. King Abdullah has dissolved parliament and called for new elections in an effort to calm the protests against his regime.      Bahrain is in the midst of turmoil that has been escalating since March 2011. Hundreds of people are missing and thousands have been injured. Iran has announced that it is ready to step in and play a positive role in resolving the issue.     Thousands of demonstrators in Kuwait have started calling for a change in the rule of the emirate. Islamic protestors told Sheikh Sabah Al Sabah, We will not allow you, your highness, to take Kuwait into the abyss of autocracy.      Discontent continues to reign in Egypt as the Muslim Brotherhood attempts to reshape the constitution. Egyptian security forces were able to stop a would-be assassin from reaching President Mahmoud Morsi in Alexandria on October 10th.     Then, of course, there is Iran, and Hamas, and the Palestinian Authority, and the issues of the West Bank (Judea and Samaria), the Golan Heights, the Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem. The list just goes on.     In a very short time, the fires that are burning now could easily erupt into a blaze of Biblical proportions. As more and more governments are toppled, and as their toppling is sold to Westerners as new democracies, we will eventually learn that there is no place in Islam for democracy and that Israel is surrounded by its worst nightmare.     God is not dead. He is still on His throne. He still has a perfect plan and He is still in control. But we cannot sit idly by in our easy chairs taking His power and authority for granted. His Word directs us to pray for peace, the peace of Jerusalem. (Psalm 126:22) So, we ask you to become a prayer warrior for Israel. Stand in the gap with us and pray.
