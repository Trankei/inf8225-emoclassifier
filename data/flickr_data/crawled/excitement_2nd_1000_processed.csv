I spent NYE on Granville St in Vancouver BC with two other fantastic photographers capturing the fun of the evening. We lined up side-by-side, many people thought we were with a newspaper or that we knew something really amazing was just about to take place and they asked what it was and wanted to watch too. I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over. I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol. I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.   Some of the photos might seem a bit strange with the movement/blur but I find them artistic and you can find some interesting pictures within a photo when you let yourself just look without expectations. You may also notice the odd clear face/s that paused in all the movement & excitement. All in all, everyone was having a fantastic time!!

The three-day event took place inside the citys Manchester Arndale Shopping Centre, showcasing a range of more than 1,000 garments and items available to fashion fans for Spring/Summer 2013.  To ensure that the high-profile event caught as much attention as possible, organisers Maynineteen called in Movetech UK to provide the rotating stage, located in Exchange Court, to carry the models and dancers.  Maynineteen marketing manager Jo Prosser said: We organise lots and lots of fashion shows and there is a pressure to do something new and different each time.   We needed something fun, but not gimmicky, and came up with the idea of the revolving stage. It worked really well, it drew in a lot of attention and gave the show the innovative edge we were hoping for.  It was all made possible by one of Movetech UKs 4.5m diameter revolving stages.  Of course, installing a large, rotating catwalk in a busy shopping centre could cause its own problems, but the Movetech UK equipment was installed in just a matter of hours, during a period when the Arndale Shopping Centre was closed to shoppers.  Jo added: Were prohibited from setting up in shopping centres whilst they are open to the public for obvious safety reasons. Build time is limited and can be stressful but fortunately it was all very straightforward for the team to put together and was ready in plenty of time for the show.  It was a test for us as we had to ensure that the dancers on board the turntable were perfectly safe as it operated, and we had a limited timeframe to install the equipment. These are the types of projects we enjoy tackling and the end result was really quite spectacular.

Even the most diehard athletes and boosters would be hard-pressed, however, to match the intensity and staying power of the fund-raising efforts backing Holmes Desmelik and Amber Rhodes.  Visit Brevard High School any day of the week to observe ""Holmes Team"" and ""Amber's Angels"" fervently chasing their goals on behalf of these fellow students.  Both Amber and Holmes suffer from cancers which cannot be fully eradicated (if at all) through surgery.  In honor of both students, Blue Devils purchased headbands for a dollar apiece, then gathered on October 9th for a star-shaped photo to honor the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation.  In the end, that first wave raised over $1,200 for the teams (see our album).  Graphics teacher Katrina Ronneburger (BHS) said, ""I wanted to help my students come up with a way they could show support for Amber Rhodes - a senior from BHS - and Holmes - whose mother Clare teaches Spanish at BHS. Both of these families have a child that's been diagnosed with a brain tumor. We came up with 'Headbands 4 Hope,' and my students jumped all over it!   ""The campaign was run through my club (BHS Graphics Club) We sold almost 100 the 1st day without any promotion. My students made posters to put all over school - and it went crazy from there.  ""Several students made generous donations and only expected one headband, others bought $20 worth to pass out to friends. We did have several anonymous donations to raise our final total to $1200.00. We donated $600 to the Desmelik family and $600 to 'Make-A-Wish' for Amber's Team.""  Clare Desmelik added, ""Thanks for showing support for our families.  Holmes was diagnosed with a tumor in his thalamus, which most doctors consider inoperable.  Right now his tumor is stable and Holmes is enjoying kindergarten. He is a great little guy with a heart of gold.  One of his goals for this year is to make a green stamp for good behavior every single day at school and not to have to get a warning from his teachers.  ""There has been an incredible amount of love and support pouring in from the community.  Our friends and Holmes' friends, many churches and small businesses have all been so generous.  I am so blessed to work in such a wonderful school system.  The folks at TCS have overwhelmed us with support.  Faculty from all of the schools have reached out, as well as the good people at the Central Office.  BHS had our back from the very first day that our world changed with his diagnosis.  The faculty, the students and their families have boosted our spirits and helped in so many ways.  The staff at BES has made Holmes feel so welcomed and Holmes sure knows his way around the high school as well!  Students and staff alike make Holmes feel like the star he is!  ""The pie challenge on October 17th is something we called 'Whipping Childhood Cancer' in order to raise awareness and send love to Amber and the Rhodes Family, as well as raise money for Make a Wish, one of Amber's favorite charities.    ""Amber's brother Garrett challenged us with this earlier this year and we of course accepted and paid it forward to 7 others, helping to raise money for the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation.  We were ready for more pies and excitement...Holmes was especially looking forward to it!""  To follow up, a group of BHS teachers have organized  ""Rent-a- Student"" to help raise money for Holmes Team to cover mounting medical bills. The registration page is located at bit.ly/rent-a-student-2014.  Holmes also has a facebook page that many in our county are already following that keeps people up to date on how things are going and of events planned.  www.facebook.com/groups/holmesteam    Honestly, we have been humbled by the love, and he Holmes Team motto is ""Love Heals.""

All your childrens projects will be sent home shortly. On Wednesday, in preparation for Waterworld and to honor our weekly theme of Finding Nemo, many of our Tadpoles and Minnows attempted the giant water slide and loved it.  To end our wonderful week, The Willows campers joined the rest of camp at Waterworld. The children drove water boats and joined in other great water activities. A terrific time was had by all!

Landrake Moto Parc was founded in 1995 and is set in 25 acres of beautiful Cornish countryside, with the track taking approximately half of the site - the rest for paddock area and spectator parking. We also have another 10 acres for additional parking for the very large events. The track is 1900km long and is a minimum of 10 metres wide with some sections 15 metres wide and sits in a valley with trees on one side. With features such as a whoop section, raised berms, ski-ramps, step-downs and step-ups, and a laptime of over two minutes, exhilarating racing is ensured. 40 GP-standard start gates lead you to a 110 metre start straight, turning out into a wide downhill and then a chicane - followed by a very popular feature with spectators immediately in front of the pits - a table-top suitable for laying down some whips and scrubs, with a 100 foot tabletop right after! All this with superb viewing for specatators.   Whilst the track is fast and flowing, its a very technical track, with some old-school features such as adverse cambers and natural terrain, combined with some man-made jumps, along with a rythm section to add to the excitement for riders and spectators alike. So, riders need sublime skills to get a winning lap here.

I decided to stop here on my way to Bridal Veil after Gary's photowalk.  It is pretty nice to be here at 8 in the morning I must say...    No crowds!  I hadn't seen the falls in about 4 years because I just don't like fighting the crowds for photos.  And I'll admit, there were two people on the bridge, but they were pretty easy to get rid of in photoshop. :) I decided I was going to get up really early to participate in Gary Randall's photowalk at the Portland Women's Forum State Park and Crown Point Vista House at sunrise and convinced dad to go with me.  The 2am beginning of the journey proved to be quite interesting.  Maybe 15 minutes south of the Tri-Cities, we drove into a large thunderstorm with lightning flashing every second.  Soon, the hammering rain began and was so heavy that I had to slow down to be able to see.  Then, out of nowhere, a mix of quarter and half inch hail started beating down on us.  It was a terrible start to my morning... driving 20mph down the interstate with hail hammering the truck.  We were out of the storm by the time we got to the junction with I-84, 40 minutes later. The only damage taken was a few scratches in the paint and the fiber glass canopy looked a bit like a golf ball on top.  The rest of the trip went without problem except for the fact that I was going to be 20 minutes to a half an hour late.  When we were nearing the Women's forum, about 20 minutes after the ""official"" sunrise time, there wasn't much color and there was a fairly thick layer of clouds.  Upon arrival, I spotted Gary and talked to him for awhile, telling him about this crazy trip.  Shortly after that, the color started to come out and quickly evolved into this.  That photo has very minimal editing done to it, just brought the brightness up a bit and did a bit of dodging to bring out the pink on the upper clouds more.  After witnessing an amazing sunrise at the Women's Forum, the group headed out to the Crown Point Vista House to take a few more photos and then listen to Gary's talk on photography.  It was a great experience and went very well I think!  After that, I decided to spend more time in the Gorge.  So, on my way to Bridal Veil, I stopped at Multnomah Falls, which I hadn't seen in 5 years (I like to avoid the crowds).  There weren't very many people there at 8:30am, but it was still more than I like when I'm shooting waterfalls.  After that, I headed to Bridal Veil and took some photos of Bridal Veil Falls.  Since the water level was lower than when I was there in December, I decided that I would venture on up to Upper Bridal Veil Falls.  Palmer Mill Road, much to my excitement, was once again open, making for easier access.  Let me tell you, there was still a ton of spray!  So I'll be back for really low water in early fall. :)  My next mission was to find that awesome red barn in the orchard that Gary always has amazing photos from. :)  I did end up finding it, but lighting and other factors made for some sub par photos.  On the way out of town, I stopped briefly at Panorama Point, but the clouds were moving in on Mount Hood, so that wasn't very spectacular either.  And the journey home was smooth and uneventful, thankfully. Thanks for viewing!

Updates - Egypt, June 30, 2013**  The second wave of the revolution has started! June 30 began as a much bigger movement than January 25. After a majority of Egyptians were fed up with Muslim Brotherhood rule they took their decision and lead the politicians to the street.  June 30 made a great start with millions of people revolting in almost all governorates of Egypt. With red cards and whistles, Egypt declared Morsi out. Rules were put for the protesters to never chant for or against the army or the police, but when a military helicopter started flying over Ithadeya many cheered for it. The loudest chant though was ""LEAVE"", all protesters united on one aim, to topple the Islamist fascist regime.  Meanwhile a few clashes between the regime supporters and revolutionaries took place in Assuyt and Beheira, leaving at least five dead and around 80 injured. In Cairo, the clashes were in front of the Muslim Brotherhood headquarters in Mokkatam where supporters fired bird-shot from the building and where met with Molotov cocktails from the protesters resulting in small fires inside the building.  June 29, 2013**  The Egyptian People did one final warm up before the Red Card comes out. Tamarod Movement (Rebel) held a press conference early Saturday at the Journalists Syndicate, the movement's founder announced that the final count was more than 22 million signatures. He called upon the people to protest on June 30 to continue what they started and topple the first civilian elected president one year after his inauguration for his failure in achieving the main objectives of the January 25 Revolution as well as putting the Muslim Brotherhood in control of the top of power of all country's sides of power. He also asserted that the number of signatures was a reflection of how much the public has turned against Morsi. It is noteworthy that the number of signatures collected is more than 85% of the number of voters in the presidential elections' second round. Egyptians took their decision and raised the red card against President Mohamed Morsi!  Egypt, June 28, 2013**  As Egypt approaches June 30, the date of the uprising called for by Tamarod (Rebel), a movement that has already collected more than 22 million signatures to ouster President Mohamed Morsi, both excitement and apprehension fill the residents of the capital. In the governorates though, the protests have started earlier than expected. On the day of the governors' reshuffling people took the streets in all governorates that had a new Muslim Brotherhood governor. As the protests became bigger they have also demanded the removal of the regime.  In the past year, the life of the average Egyptian has become harder everyday; prices of essential products never seize to increase, people had to stand in endless lines to find diesel, every house and workplace all over Cairo suffer from water and power cuts. All this lead to rising aggression between a great percentage of the population. Anger was dramatically increased when Egypt ran out of gas and the streets of Cairo turned into one big parking lot.  By the beginning of the week, it has become known that Ann Patterson, U.S. Ambassador to Egypt met with Khairat El Shater, deputy supreme guide of the Muslim Brotherhood. The meeting with a non-governmental-official was never explained by the embassy, but it has become clear that the U.S. Administration still supports the Muslim Brotherhood rule, and President Morsi as part of it. The U.S. Administration that has always claimed to encourage democratic change in developing countries, proved itself wrong after the Arab Spring. It is now understood that the American support is always given to a group whom they believe will give them the most benefit regardless of the group's view on people's freedom. For this reason, a new addition to the revolution's banners was ones against Obama, Patterson and the U.S. Administration in general.  The Defense Minister, Abd El Fattah El Sisi has been very discreet about his stance regarding the Muslim Brotherhood rule. On Sunday he gave a vague speech that has kept people wondering if we'll be facing a coup in the coming days, especially when he mentioned that the army's role is to protect the will of the people. One day after the minister has spoken a National Security Council meeting was announced. The meeting's statement expressed the attendees' respect to peaceful protests and declared that the parliamentary elections will be held in a few months, once the elections law is approved. The presidency has also announced that the president will give a speech on Wednesday to celebrate the first anniversary of his inauguration.  Tamarod met the announcement of the president's speech with calling for a protest to watch him in Tahrir Square. After the whole country waited in front of a television, Morsi spoke for almost three hours saying complete nonsense. The speech that had not once mentioned June 30 or the clashes that were happening in Mansoura a few hours before he spoke, had one aim; to show that the army and police are on the side of the regime. This was proven, from the president's opinion, after both ministers of Defense and Interior were present in the front row listening to his speech, and after mentioning five times that he's the commander-in-chief of the police and armed forces.  Two days before the revolution, the plan was to mobilize all governorates but Greater Cairo's. Today what actually happened was that there were protests in almost every city and village in Egypt. While Alexandria, Dakahleya, Port Said, Dameitta, Monofeya, Gharbeya, Sharqeya and Beni Souief had huge protests, Greater Cairo had four sit-ins for the first time since January 25, 2011. As protesters poured in in Tahrir Square, others stayed in Kitkat in Giza, and others in front of the Ministry of Defense. A warm up has started with two small sit-ins in the vicinity of the Presidential Palace in Heliopolis. The day has faced clashes in many cities between revolutionaries and regime supporters that left two dead, one of which is an American citizen, and 227 injured.  **Text by: Mariam Saleh (mariam-saleh.blogspot.com)"

Even the most diehard athletes and boosters would be hard-pressed, however, to match the intensity and staying power of the fund-raising efforts backing Holmes Desmelik and Amber Rhodes.  Visit Brevard High School any day of the week to observe ""Holmes Team"" and ""Amber's Angels"" fervently chasing their goals on behalf of these fellow students.  Both Amber and Holmes suffer from cancers which cannot be fully eradicated (if at all) through surgery.  In honor of both students, Blue Devils purchased headbands for a dollar apiece, then gathered on October 9th for a star-shaped photo to honor the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation.  In the end, that first wave raised over $1,200 for the teams (see our album).  Graphics teacher Katrina Ronneburger (BHS) said, ""I wanted to help my students come up with a way they could show support for Amber Rhodes - a senior from BHS - and Holmes - whose mother Clare teaches Spanish at BHS. Both of these families have a child that's been diagnosed with a brain tumor. We came up with 'Headbands 4 Hope,' and my students jumped all over it!   ""The campaign was run through my club (BHS Graphics Club) We sold almost 100 the 1st day without any promotion. My students made posters to put all over school - and it went crazy from there.  ""Several students made generous donations and only expected one headband, others bought $20 worth to pass out to friends. We did have several anonymous donations to raise our final total to $1200.00. We donated $600 to the Desmelik family and $600 to 'Make-A-Wish' for Amber's Team.""  Clare Desmelik added, ""Thanks for showing support for our families.  Holmes was diagnosed with a tumor in his thalamus, which most doctors consider inoperable.  Right now his tumor is stable and Holmes is enjoying kindergarten. He is a great little guy with a heart of gold.  One of his goals for this year is to make a green stamp for good behavior every single day at school and not to have to get a warning from his teachers.  ""There has been an incredible amount of love and support pouring in from the community.  Our friends and Holmes' friends, many churches and small businesses have all been so generous.  I am so blessed to work in such a wonderful school system.  The folks at TCS have overwhelmed us with support.  Faculty from all of the schools have reached out, as well as the good people at the Central Office.  BHS had our back from the very first day that our world changed with his diagnosis.  The faculty, the students and their families have boosted our spirits and helped in so many ways.  The staff at BES has made Holmes feel so welcomed and Holmes sure knows his way around the high school as well!  Students and staff alike make Holmes feel like the star he is!  ""The pie challenge on October 17th is something we called 'Whipping Childhood Cancer' in order to raise awareness and send love to Amber and the Rhodes Family, as well as raise money for Make a Wish, one of Amber's favorite charities.    ""Amber's brother Garrett challenged us with this earlier this year and we of course accepted and paid it forward to 7 others, helping to raise money for the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation.  We were ready for more pies and excitement...Holmes was especially looking forward to it!""  To follow up, a group of BHS teachers have organized  ""Rent-a- Student"" to help raise money for Holmes Team to cover mounting medical bills. The registration page is located at bit.ly/rent-a-student-2014.  Holmes also has a facebook page that many in our county are already following that keeps people up to date on how things are going and of events planned.  www.facebook.com/groups/holmesteam    Honestly, we have been humbled by the love, and he Holmes Team motto is ""Love Heals.""

The staff at BES has made Holmes feel so welcomed and Holmes sure knows his way around the high school as well!  Students and staff alike make Holmes feel like the star he is!  ""The pie challenge on October 17th is something we called 'Whipping Childhood Cancer' in order to raise awareness and send love to Amber and the Rhodes Family, as well as raise money for Make a Wish, one of Amber's favorite charities.    ""Amber's brother Garrett challenged us with this earlier this year and we of course accepted and paid it forward to 7 others, helping to raise money for the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation.  We were ready for more pies and excitement...Holmes was especially looking forward to it!""  To follow up, a group of BHS teachers have organized  ""Rent-a- Student"" to help raise money for Holmes Team to cover mounting medical bills. The registration page is located at bit.ly/rent-a-student-2014.  Holmes also has a facebook page that many in our county are already following that keeps people up to date on how things are going and of events planned.  www.facebook.com/groups/holmesteam    Honestly, we have been humbled by the love, and he Holmes Team motto is ""Love Heals.""

This is the amazing story of two Ethiopian marathon runners  Sintayehi Legese Yinesu (28) and Meseret Mengistu Biru (26)  who each pocketed R100 000 after respectively clinching victory in the mens and womens categories of the 42,2km race of the new-look Soweto Marathon on Sunday.  Yinesu finished the race in 2 hours 17 minutes, while Biru made it in 2 hours 36 minutes.  The sensational way in which the duo cruised to victory was all the marathon needed to relaunch itself after it was briefly put off course by internal wrangling in Athletics South Africa.  The 2012 champion, Shadrack Kemboi of Kenya, also took part but failed to place in the top three positions, such was the intensity of the competition.  The Soweto Marathon is back with a bang, elated Soweto Marathon Director and Organiser Banele Sindane exclaimed. And its here to stay. Our aim is to grow the race so it can be counted among the best in the world. Already, the race has made a name for itself.  Earlier  at 6am to be exact  there was a sense of anticipation and excitement as Johannesburg Executive Mayor Mpho Parks Tau signalled the start of the marathon at the Nasrec Exhibition Centre outside Soweto.  Gauteng Premier David Makhura was one of the celebrities at the starting point to take part in the marathon.  More than 20 000 runners took part in this years marathon, which was divided into three: 42,2km race, 21,1km race and 10km race.  The weather, which can be a spoil sport sometimes, also did not disappoint. It was a mild and glorious day, perfect for running.  Yinesu and Biru were not the only foreigners who dominated the marathon. In the main mens race, Lesotho nationals Tebogo Sello and Motlokoa Nkhabutlane took second and third positions respectively. In the womens main race, it was Isabella Jepchumba of Kenya who came second.  But South Africans were not to be completely outdone. Joel Moni gallantly clinched victory in the 21,1km mens race, while Xoliswa Ntshali came second. The womens version of the race was won by Mapaseka Makhanya.  Both Galant and Makhanya won R10 000 each for their remarkable efforts.  Desmond Mokgobu outran and outpaced his challengers to win the 10km mens race, pocketing R5 000 in prize-money in the process. Lebogang won the womens race and also received R5 000 for her efforts.  Johannesburgs municipal-owned entities such as JMPD and the Emergency Management Services were on hand to make the marathon an incident-free and memorable event.  Mayor Tau fully supports the marathon as it eloquently speaks to the Citys Healthy Lifestyle Programme, which encourages Johannesburg residents to engage in physical activities such as running, walking and cycling to improve their health and enhance the citys life expectancy.  Sponsors such as Nike, Nedbank, Coca-Cola and the National Lottery contributed to the success of this years edition of the marathon.

All your childrens projects will be sent home shortly. On Wednesday, in preparation for Waterworld and to honor our weekly theme of Finding Nemo, many of our Tadpoles and Minnows attempted the giant water slide and loved it.  To end our wonderful week, The Willows campers joined the rest of camp at Waterworld. The children drove water boats and joined in other great water activities. A terrific time was had by all!

This is the amazing story of two Ethiopian marathon runners  Sintayehi Legese Yinesu (28) and Meseret Mengistu Biru (26)  who each pocketed R100 000 after respectively clinching victory in the mens and womens categories of the 42,2km race of the new-look Soweto Marathon on Sunday.  Yinesu finished the race in 2 hours 17 minutes, while Biru made it in 2 hours 36 minutes.  The sensational way in which the duo cruised to victory was all the marathon needed to relaunch itself after it was briefly put off course by internal wrangling in Athletics South Africa.  The 2012 champion, Shadrack Kemboi of Kenya, also took part but failed to place in the top three positions, such was the intensity of the competition.  The Soweto Marathon is back with a bang, elated Soweto Marathon Director and Organiser Banele Sindane exclaimed. And its here to stay. Our aim is to grow the race so it can be counted among the best in the world. Already, the race has made a name for itself.  Earlier  at 6am to be exact  there was a sense of anticipation and excitement as Johannesburg Executive Mayor Mpho Parks Tau signalled the start of the marathon at the Nasrec Exhibition Centre outside Soweto.  Gauteng Premier David Makhura was one of the celebrities at the starting point to take part in the marathon.  More than 20 000 runners took part in this years marathon, which was divided into three: 42,2km race, 21,1km race and 10km race.  The weather, which can be a spoil sport sometimes, also did not disappoint. It was a mild and glorious day, perfect for running.  Yinesu and Biru were not the only foreigners who dominated the marathon. In the main mens race, Lesotho nationals Tebogo Sello and Motlokoa Nkhabutlane took second and third positions respectively. In the womens main race, it was Isabella Jepchumba of Kenya who came second.  But South Africans were not to be completely outdone. Joel Moni gallantly clinched victory in the 21,1km mens race, while Xoliswa Ntshali came second. The womens version of the race was won by Mapaseka Makhanya.  Both Galant and Makhanya won R10 000 each for their remarkable efforts.  Desmond Mokgobu outran and outpaced his challengers to win the 10km mens race, pocketing R5 000 in prize-money in the process. Lebogang won the womens race and also received R5 000 for her efforts.  Johannesburgs municipal-owned entities such as JMPD and the Emergency Management Services were on hand to make the marathon an incident-free and memorable event.  Mayor Tau fully supports the marathon as it eloquently speaks to the Citys Healthy Lifestyle Programme, which encourages Johannesburg residents to engage in physical activities such as running, walking and cycling to improve their health and enhance the citys life expectancy.  Sponsors such as Nike, Nedbank, Coca-Cola and the National Lottery contributed to the success of this years edition of the marathon.

Landrake Moto Parc was founded in 1995 and is set in 25 acres of beautiful Cornish countryside, with the track taking approximately half of the site - the rest for paddock area and spectator parking.

The track is 1900km long and is a minimum of 10 metres wide with some sections 15 metres wide and sits in a valley with trees on one side.

His crche says he's sur la lune (on the moon), which whilst not exactly meaning he's completely loony is a sneaky French way of saying he's on another planet, or at best has his head in the clouds. Ahh, that's my boy!  But back to this pic. He's got a thing about trains, shouts with excitement whenever he sees one, and can spend hours with his little mitts clinging to the railings looking down on the platforms at Denfert Rochereau, completely fascinated by every monstrous RER which thunders by.  And then there's planes. Despite the fact that Spanish, French and English are all competing with each other in his head at the moment, I'm quite pleased to say that 'aeroplane (up in the sky)', give or take the odd syllable or three, is what automatically comes out of his mouth every time he spots a you-know-what. And he spots a lot.  He seems to have a sixth sense for the things. Two seconds out of the door, and the sky-gazing has begun. Eyes aloft, finger pointing, voice rising with excitement: ""Eh-play uppi skaheey! Eh-play uppi skaheey!"" Lack of equivalent adult minder enthusiasm is highly frowned upon. This is not to be taken lightly. Each plane deserves its very own delerium.  We live on the Orly airport flight path just to the south of Paris. We know about aeroplanes up in the sky. Oh yes.  I comfort myself with images of a lucrative air traffic controller career for him in later life and can't help thinking that there's a certain truth to the old 'like father like son' adage.  As I wander around the lesser-known outer arrondissements of the city I often find myself coming into close contact with these slumbering snakes shown above, and they're generally pretty photo-worthy to my eyes.  Hence this picture for my little train-spotter, hoping that these latent anorak tendencies don't worsen into something more serious as he approaches adulthood. For me I think it's already too late."

For more information look at www.baytobirdwood.com.au/the_run.html  I got to the grounds early (about 6am) and watched the oval fill from nothing. 1800 cars were expected for the biggest event of this type in the world.   From the website ""The sun will not yet have risen over the Adelaide Hills when the very first vehicles start arriving at Adelaide Shores. It may only be 6am but the excitement will already be palpable as these marvellous veteran, vintage and early classic vehicles ready themselves for the biennial Bay to Birdwood Run.

Enjoy a range of breakfasts provided by local service organisations washed down with jazz and other vintage entertainment, line the start ahead of the flag off by the one and only Glen Dix at 8:30 am and be a part of this icon event.

Vehicles head down West Beach Road after the official Start turning right into Tapleys Hill Road then left into Anzac Highway. Their journey through metropolitan Adelaide en route to the Finish at the National Motor Museum in Birdwood enables the spectators who line the 72km route each year to see Australia's greatest motoring show on wheels pass right in front of them - 2 hours of motoring history!""
