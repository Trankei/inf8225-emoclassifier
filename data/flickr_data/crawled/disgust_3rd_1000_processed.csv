To a lot of people earwigs tend to provoke disgust or a feeling of unease. However this is less due to the mythology that they crawl into the ears and chew into the brain and more to do with the fact that they are typically found in places which we are inherently uncomfortable around; that is to say compost heaps, under wood or bricks and other warm and humid places. Their scuttling behaviour, and menacing pincers hardly endear them any further. Despite people's aversion, they are rather innocuous insects with only some causing damage to crops or flowers.  Earwigs display strong photophobic tendencies, retreating back into the darkness when exposed to  light. Consequently they are predominantly nocturnal, their morphology supports this lifestyle, flattened, muscular bodies enabling them to wedge into cracks and crevices. However, they leave behind the safety of shelter when dusk descends whereupon they begin foraging. Diet is largely omnivorous, however some species may be more inclined towards either carnivory or herbivory. In the former case, the long cerci (pincers) are used to catch and kill their prey.  Earwigs typically live one year during which time they undergo ~5 moults. Their sexual identity becomes apparent towards the second moult when the shape of the cerci can be used as a sexual determinant: curved cerci for males and straight ones for females. Nevertheless some species may show other dimorphisms. As previously mentioned the cerci function to catch prey, but they can also be used for defense, assuming a curled up posture when feeling threatened. A more benign purpose though is to help fold their wings under the elytra/tegmina and for use in mating rituals.  Perhaps the caring parental habits of females will help to assuage people's discomfort around dermapterans. Females lay between 20-80 eggs and vigorously defend them until they hatch. During this period females clean the eggs assiduously to prevent fungal colonization of her brood. When the young do hatch the female feeds her young by regurgitating food for them and continues providing care until around the second instar stage when the young are capable of fending for themselves. Though survival is far from assured, as young earwigs have to contend with many predators, ranging from Amphibians and reptiles to Arachnids and parasitic tachinid flies."
