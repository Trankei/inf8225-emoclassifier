The door there opened into the countryside, where we could stealthily escape to another secret base, deep within the Alps.   We got to the medic bay fairly quickly only to see two Russians laughing and kicking at a doctor who had worked there. I recognized him as Herr Winkler, the head doctor, himself! He had created the re-stimulation serum all soldiers in the base were injected with. It causes short stimulation of the nerves and muscles once the subject has died and allows them to have a second go at the enemy before dying one last time.   Ullrich poked his head through the doorway, his rifle drawn. Unfortunately, the Russians saw him within seconds. The one that was armed spun on his heel and sent several shots through Ullrich's head. He collapsed but his skin quickly became papery and grey. his eyes rolled back and his lips retracted. He stood once again, a disgusting undead beast. He charged at the man who had not shot him and drove his fingers straight through his eye sockets. He yelled, as his stunned friend began shooting again. Ullrich began to retreat, but he tripped over a bed in the infirmary and was cut down. Suddenly, Dr. Winkler drew his pistol and shot the screaming man dead as his friend was reloading. He turned to shoot him just as my son entered the room.  He bellowed and charged, tackling the swine to the ground. He punched him in the face with a sickening crack. Oh, it was wonderful to see those who had defeated us suffer like this! The man was crawling towards the door, tears streaming down his face when my son shakes his head violently, and picks the man up. He thrusts him over his head and holds him over his head. Suddenly, the man screams. My son's teeth are gritted and his arms are moving apart, very slowly. There's a ripping of cloth and then a loud tearing followed my blood curdling crying and screaming and then a thunk as the two halves of the swine fall to the ground.   I strut into the room, and pick up Ullrich's old rifle. The man torn in half is somehow still slightly breathing, and I end that with a bullet through the skull.  ""Herr Schwieger.... good to see you my friend!"" Winkler says, embracing me. We were as close as brothers during the war, despite the large age difference.  ""And you, Herr Winkler! Unfortunate that we should meet again under such terms.""  ""Indeed! But perhaps we can still help the Fatherland?""  I chuck my rifle towards the bench where Ullrich fell and slump down against the door.   ""Once we exit this door"" I say, tapping the door behind me ""We are at the Russian's mercy once again. We'll have to take uniforms from the two non-mangled men, and my son... we'll hide his face and make him look like walking wounded. We'll escape to the Alpine Base and discuss further plans with Herr Mller. There are bases on other continents we can still access fairly readily. We must not waste time. The world is in shock from this defeat still and the USA still has forces deployed in the Pacific.""  ""So what you are saying is, if we are fast, we can establish ourselves within the USA... and then what?""  ""There are likeminded Americans, I am sure of it, Herr Winkler. We can raise an army.""  ""And where would we find such people?""  ""During my time in America during the 30's I stumbled upon a crime-ridden city. Now, the city itself is too risky but the countryside? It is ideal! We shall not only survive, but thrive!""  ""I like this idea very much, Herr Schweiger... but where would we find such a place?""  ""Gotham County."" ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ "
disgust,http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4036/4292680770_8ab2c4419e_z.jpg,2,3,"25.365 - Old Habits I am notoriously bad at sticking to things.  Any of you who have been following my 365 may have noticed this.  At the same time, I am a creature of habit.  This makes reforming my habits very difficult.  I become very emotionally attached to the ritual of doing certain things, and this is (primarily) what makes quitting smoking very difficult.  I enjoy smoking.  As a ritual.  It is comforting in a weird, turn-about sort of way.  I know it is awful for me.  I say (time and time again) that I am under no delusion that smoking is good for me.  In fact, I often cite, it is a rare smoker that pretends that smoking is--in any way--good for them.  I am no different.  I know it is horrible.  It is a nasty, disgusting habit.  I do not want to be a smoker for the rest of my life.  That said, I attempted to quit smoking in 2009.  We can see how well that went.  For the most part, I was good.  But, as is the case with most things, it is the exception, and not the rule, that matters.  The fact that I smoked at all was not good.  It meant that I had not truly quit.  As is evidenced by this photo, I am still not quite over that compulsion.  I find that physically, at least, quitting smoking is not difficult.  Emotionally, however, was a whole different ball game.  I enjoy smoking.  It is a highly social activity that has brought many things to my life.  At the end of the day, though, that is not enough of a reason to hold on to the habit.  Earlier tonight, when I was hanging out at Barefoot Coffee Roasters, a good friend of mine, Melissa, confessed that she had quit.  Her reasons were not purely altruistic in the end--it turns out that the expense was one of her chief concerns.

For those of you who have been championing this decision, this is for you.  For those on whom I have made this decision very difficult, I apologize.  And for the rest of you I say this, ""It really is never too late.""  Go out and do the things that you want to do.  Do what you know is best.

London U.K. 22/02/2011  On a day which saw prime minister David Cameron holding photo opportunities on his current tour of Middle-Eastern countries in which he made many silken-tongued media-friendly statements about democracy in the region, a large crowd of angry Libyan protesters gathered at the gates of Downing Street to not only honour the many dead and seriously injured back home as they attempt to fight off Gadaffi's vicious hired mercenary killers, but also to demand that Cameron take much stronger steps to support the anti-Gadaffi freedom movement by not only sebering all diplomatic and trade connections with the Libyan regime, and to freeze Libyan assets and hold Gadaffi accountable for his crimes.  Organised by the Libya Freedom & Democracy Campaign, many were openly disgusted at the news that Cameron was accompanied on his trip by representatives from six of the largest British arms manufacturers, who are using HM Government as their personal salesman to continue selling weapons and armaments to the very same oppressive regimes which are currently brutally putting down their own populations as they clamour for the same basic freedoms and human rights which they see are enjoyed by Western countries.

The reptile has unique defensive capabilities; it can flatten its head and neck (as in photo) and rear up while loudly hissing, thus looking something like a cobra.   If that doesn't work, it sprays musk and feces around and rolls onto its back with its tongue hanging out playing dead, a disgusting display that can deter hungry predators.

Ditmars Blvd Astoria, NY 11105  This supermarket has been severely negligent in maintaining clean and safe garbage disposal practices on 43rd. Street between Ditmars Blvd. and 23rd. Ave. in Astoria Queens.  These photos were taken over a period of time that demonstrate their practice of substantially overfilling the small, few and broken garbage receptacles they have. The substantial overflow lands all over the sidewalk next to the entrance of residents homes. It then runs into the gutter and down the block. This turns 43rd. St. into an open sewer that attracts rats and all manner of bugs. The carting company does not clean this up. So this ""Garbage Stew"" remains for many hours putrefying on the street.  During the hot summer months the odor from this ""Garbage Stew"" is unbearable. The block always smells like garbage.There are apartments and resident windows right next to the garbage and loading dock area and private homes located across the street. The residents, which include elderly and families with children, should not have to accept this irresponsible and disgusting practice. As the residents have helped in prospering this supermarket with it's patronage, Berry Fresh Farm Inc. in kind, should have a responsibility to the community by adopting safe and sanitary garbage disposal practices."

To a lot of people earwigs tend to provoke disgust or a feeling of unease. However this is less due to the mythology that they crawl into the ears and chew into the brain and more to do with the fact that they are typically found in places which we are inherently uncomfortable around; that is to say compost heaps, under wood or bricks and other warm and humid places. Their scuttling behaviour, and menacing pincers hardly endear them any further. Despite people's aversion, they are rather innocuous insects with only some causing damage to crops or flowers.  Earwigs display strong photophobic tendencies, retreating back into the darkness when exposed to  light. Consequently they are predominantly nocturnal, their morphology supports this lifestyle, flattened, muscular bodies enabling them to wedge into cracks and crevices. However, they leave behind the safety of shelter when dusk descends whereupon they begin foraging. Diet is largely omnivorous, however some species may be more inclined towards either carnivory or herbivory. In the former case, the long cerci (pincers) are used to catch and kill their prey.  Earwigs typically live one year during which time they undergo ~5 moults. Their sexual identity becomes apparent towards the second moult when the shape of the cerci can be used as a sexual determinant: curved cerci for males and straight ones for females. Nevertheless some species may show other dimorphisms. As previously mentioned the cerci function to catch prey, but they can also be used for defense, assuming a curled up posture when feeling threatened. A more benign purpose though is to help fold their wings under the elytra/tegmina and for use in mating rituals.  Perhaps the caring parental habits of females will help to assuage people's discomfort around dermapterans. Females lay between 20-80 eggs and vigorously defend them until they hatch. During this period females clean the eggs assiduously to prevent fungal colonization of her brood. When the young do hatch the female feeds her young by regurgitating food for them and continues providing care until around the second instar stage when the young are capable of fending for themselves. Though survival is far from assured, as young earwigs have to contend with many predators, ranging from Amphibians and reptiles to Arachnids and parasitic tachinid flies."

We had to have been on that bus for seven hours, sometimes napping, and at times, staring out our windows, looking at a world standing still. Traffic was not only a nightmare, but also a mystery, for as many instances in which we could plainly see another egregiously bad vehicular accident, that which has become commonplace, ubiquitous in Chinese travel culture, there were other inexplicable stops in movement, when all of a sudden, as though finishing a swift countdown, our speed dropped so precipitously as to let out a collective lurch, if not in body, then definitely in mind. Calvin, thankfully, in his perspicacity, in his wide-angled, unique view of things, saw beyond the myriad vehicles which lay unmoving as if rocks on a dry riverbed; view the periphery, he bade us, and when we looked to the edges of the road, indeed we witnessed the most peculiar instigator of traffic congestion in the world - men en masse pissing on the side of the road!  Men taking leaks creates a domino effect; that one sees another enjoying the relief of an unburdened, easy bladder, so seductive a yoke, that the only retort to the entreaty of this blissful state is to join in with abandon, and impunity.  And so soon as the last few shakes are made, back into the cars do these men go, and a few hasty minutes later, traffic flows again!  Mike wanted to stop at a village, so we exchanged an increasingly crowded highway for a narrow, cement road, on which we ventured into the dense verdure. Having reached an impasse in the road soon thereafter, and not knowing how to advance further, to actually enter the village proper, we saw two lovely young ladies saddling a moped, motoring towards us. They then suddenly broke, and turned off our path and onto a dirt one which squeezed through two homes as though a mouse through its diminutive hole - that was our key. We greeted them as the girls turned their heads, offering us inquisitive, yet gentle looks. They would be our guides into town.  Blue showed me around her neighborhood. Together we walked along bumpy corridors and peered through open windows, beyond flitting cobwebs, to lay eyes on rooms where nowadays only impenetrable shadows repose. She and I examined the perfunctory red banners which framed each door in the village, and subsequently hit it off when I began inquiring into the nature of those two swarthy demons who hung menacingly before the closed doors, their gazes insidiously wild, drunk with rage, perhaps. Indeed later, in the quietude of a sunset raining down on us, while standing by ourselves in front of the village hall, I finally shared my faith with her, and in return she declared the lack of her own - her cousin and older sister, however, do know Jesus, she said, which verily warmed my heart, if not hers.  We left the village with much rapidity, but not before I blessed and encouraged Blue's cousin, in whose arms a smiling babe lay, and received joyfully a delectable departing gift: mysterious, ""Blue Cookies"" (the official Chinese name is ), whose mottled, homely complexion would disgust if not for the sweetness (an amalgam of sugar, peanuts and herbs) buried inside, a treasure which would be discovered again and again on our tour.  The food around Enping epitomizes, I believe, Guangdong cuisine: inexpensive and egregiously non-spicy. For what they lack in price and incendiary acidity, however, these dishes more than compensate with copious amounts of oil, salt and sugar, mixed together for a tantalizing effect on the taste buds. Our group was fortunate enough to have frequented several Guangdong-style dai pai dongs whose victuals both nourished our bodies and replenished our wallets - it's amazing to consider how $250RMB can feed 15 ravenous, cantankerous-when-hungry Christian bikers. In fact, the feasting grew exponentially more enjoyable as journey progressed, as our two primary orderers began to refine their culinary acuity, accurately predicting what would invigorate and excite our collective palate; it helped, too, that our utensils were pretty clean for Chinese standards!  Our first evening, we secured accommodations in a building that was not so much a hotel, or even a motel, as a grey, dry concrete edifice in which hardwood beds were arrayed neatly in each room; the spartan conditions dismayed some, including myself, at first.  However, thankfulness trumped peevishness, and the realization that, in the middle of nowhere, we had mosquito nets to ward off the inexorable squad of mozzies, and one bathroom with boiling water for a very, very scalding shower was more than enough to placate everyone, especially after a hard day of riding.  Besides, austerity succors the soul.  We even managed to sleep pretty soundly without mattresses.  In my somnolent state, I only remember shifting desperately maybe six, or seven times.  It was a good night, and a bargain at only 15RMB per person!  On the second day our group dared to test itself on an unknown avenue. Consequently, we were spared the sonorous alarms of gigantic, indomitable trucks and instead subjected ourselves to the vicissitudes of off-road biking, whose soundtrack, undoubtedly for the day, was provided by an orchestra of buzzing cicadas, accompanied, at times, by the rumbling tympani of motorbikes. Oh, the countryside was lush, beautiful verdure all around - a feast for the romantic soul. Yet, for one of my companions, the environment was anything but endearing, for her adeptness at handling the desultory trail, she surely felt, was more chaotic than controlled. She persevered, nonetheless, pushing through her disconsolation to conquer the race marked out for her; such tenacity that only the Father could supply; and that left me thoroughly impressed.  At lunchtime, the evangelization effort began in earnest.  It started innocently enough, as I asked a group of girls about the secondary school down the dusty road from our restaurant.  Then, on cue, the Spirit, whose pacing can only be described as frenetic, whose rhythm is beyond my comprehension, overwhelmed and took over.  Leanne and I brought those three girls to Christ; while Tim was assiduously preaching by our side to a band of boys who had gathered to look on; and behind us, ah Cheung had cajoled five boys to form a circle, hand in hand, for prayer.  Many people came to know Jesus that hour.  There was undoubtedly some serious fire falling down on us!  We made a pit stop at the Tam clan village.  It was another bucolic community, replete with idling boys, young and old,  and those two duplicitous demons standing watch from steady doors, which, it appeared, held together together the ramshackle walls beside them.  An electricity meter evinced the reality of life in the village, of a living community that flows flittingly in and out of the houses as though cats leaping over canals; because I for one couldn't see how hundreds of people somehow resided inside those homes when I couldn't spot a single one during my brief tour of the grounds.  In the open, by our bikes, there were conspicuous signs of life, however.  I  was standing in the sun, letting its warm rays melt on my skin, when a young man, not even twenty, approached and asked me about our intents and purposes on what was once such a dull afternoon.  His curiosity got the better of me, and together we broached a conversation in faith.  Simon joined us, and although he whom I named Henry, told us in his obstinacy that he depends on himself alone, I feel as though a small seed of faith was still planted within him.  May it bloom at the appointed time when he most needs it.   At last, inside the unlit store where we shared our gleaming hopes and fantastic dreams, Simon and I noticed, to our surprise and delight, two blackboards on which the shopkeeper had written the alphabet, for English as well as for Putonghua (Pinyin).  Besides the letters, numbers too had been painstakingly etched into the board, each meticulous stroke perfectly formed.  So they ironically were learning that which continues to elude their more economically mobile brethren in Hong Kong, despite their most humble upbringing.  I encouraged Henry to pursue this knowledge, since, as the cliche most rightly states, English - and Putonghua, these days - opens up a world of opportunity.   China, it seems to me, is one interminable housing start being carried on the shoulders of giants. Behemoths, really, an armada of green and blue dump trucks, on whose backs are the physical manifestation of the hopes and dreams of billions - timber; stone; and coal - were an inescapable part of our three-day trek. They blew passed us, literally, horns afire; and if you stared into the eyes of the drivers high above on those mechanized elephants, you would see the glee with which they pounded both the road and the eardrums of those unwitting peons foolish enough to be nearby. China - and China Mobile, whose stores we uncovered even in the most remote suburb, might I add! - still has much growth left, and the transportation and infrastructure industries, I'm sure, shall assiduously work to keep it that way. My recommendation: keep investing in China.  Visiting the hot springs had been on our agenda since the inception of the trip.  We eventually had our chance the second evening, when we raced down a wending hill to our hotel - a real hotel.  Our excitement reverberated in the air, crackling with laughter and shouting.  Choosing to swim first and foremost, we left dinner to wait and hurried across the street.  The resort was packed with other like-minded people, dressed in swimming costumes that should have left more to the imagination; the temperature of the pool water varied, from tepid in one enclosure to skin-searing in another; and for one marvelous hour, we swam and frolicked like little children again, delighting in some wet fun, a suitable reward for one more arduous day spent on the dusty, dry land.   We capped the end of a successful day with a bang.  The girls, oddly enough, were furtive pyromaniacs in our midst, longing in secret to raid the fireworks shop at the base of the hotel.  So after our meal, they raced into the cool evening air and we could only endeavor to follow them in their explosive folly.  Inside the store, all sorts of bombastic devices were on display, from the unwieldy, block of (Chicago) bull to the sleek spears adorning the wall whose warheads, no doubt, could just so easily take out a few eyes as mercilessly rip the pitch black from the wall of night sky.  The ladies suffered to leave no type of firework untouched by the flame, quickly purchasing an arsenal of rainbow-inducing rockets and slim sparklers to make any pyrotechnic maven proud.  Outside we went.  At length, the bombs burst in the air, and laughter abound so much as we watched the brilliance of Chinese engineering on display.  With the girls' scintillating stock depleted, we finally collected ourselves, and headed upstairs for one more day of wonderment.  There was one last village to visit before we reached our final destination of Enping city.  As we sped into the shanty community, we knew something was amiss because unlike our other entrances into villages, during which residents would emerge in droves to glimpse us, it seemed as though these villagers preferred the comfort of their own veiled homes to the company of a few, ebullient strangers.  It was an ominous setting in which we found ourselves, one characterized by inhabitants rather mistrustful than gregarious, and affable.  Nonetheless, we dispersed to share kindness and mercy.  To that end, I approached a young lady, a mere 25-years old, who had her three-month old boy on her shoulder and her three-year old son - who was without pants, might I add, preferring to wave them in the air like a terrible towel - by her side.  We spoke briefly about her hopes and dreams, which, she says, rest in the well-being of her sons; and then Leanne and I blessed her.  That was the end of our village experience in China.  To be around people who sharpen you as iron sharpens iron, that verily is a joy.  The villagers were simple, warm and welcoming; my teammates were jocular, presumptuous and faithful; and I, in the midst of this confluence, this mosaic of personalities, philosophies, hopes and dreams, could only seek to love, especially in one of my more pensive moments.  The trip tested my patience and tolerance, my ability to accept others for who they are - each a flawed creature like myself.   Ultimately, so much as we seek the men of peace everywhere we go, we individually must become men of peace too.  A true disciple of Jesus runs that race, and appreciates His grace, which shall always be enough in this life."

Marine Iguana The Marine Iguana (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) is an iguana found only on the Galapagos Islands that has the ability, unique among modern lizards, to live and forage in the sea. It has spread to all the islands in the archipelago, and is sometimes called the Galapagos Marine Iguana. It mainly lives on the rocky Galapagos shore, but can also be spotted in marshes and mangrove beaches.  On his visit to the islands, Charles Darwin was revolted by the animals' appearance, writing The black Lava rocks on the beach are frequented by large (2-3 ft), disgusting clumsy Lizards. They are as black as the porous rocks over which they crawl & seek their prey from the Sea. I call them 'imps of darkness'. They assuredly well become the land they inhabit.  In fact, Amblyrhynchus cristatus is not always black; the young have a lighter coloured dorsal stripe, and some adult specimens are grey. The reason for the sombre tones is that the species must rapidly absorb heat to minimize the period of lethargy after emerging from the water. They feed almost exclusively on marine algae, expelling the excess salt from nasal glands while basking in the sun, and the coating of salt can make their faces appear white. In adult males, coloration varies with the season. Breeding-season adult males on the southern islands are the most colorful and will acquire reddish and teal-green colors, while on Santa Cruz they are brick red and black, and on Fernandina they are brick red and dull greenish.  Another difference between the iguanas is size, which is different depending on the island the individual iguana inhabits. The iguanas living on the islands of Fernandina and Isabela (named for the famous rulers of Spain) are the largest found anywhere in the Galpagos. On the other end of the spectrum, the smallest iguanas are found on the island on Genovesa.  Adult males are approximately 1.3 m long, females 0.6 m, males weigh up to 1.5 kg.  On land, the marine iguana is rather a clumsy animal, but in the water it is a graceful swimmer, using its powerful tail to propel itself.  As an exothermic animal, the marine iguana can spend only a limited time in the cold sea, where it dives for algae. However, by swimming only in the shallow waters around the island they are able to survive single dives of up to half an hour at depths of more than 15 m. After these dives, they return to their territory to bask in the sun and warm up again. When cold, the iguana is unable to move effectively, making them vulnerable to predation, so they become highly aggressive before heating up (since they are unable to run away they try to bite attackers in this state). During the breeding season, males become highly territorial. The males assemble large groups of females to mate with, and guard them against other male iguanas. However, at other times the species is only aggressive when cold.  Marine iguanas have also been found to change their size to adapt to varying food conditions. During El Nio conditions when the algae that the iguanas feed on was scarce for a period of two years, some were found to decrease their length by as much as 20%. When food conditions returned to normal, the iguanas returned to their pre-famine size. It is speculated that the bones of the iguanas actually shorten as a shrinkage of connective tissue could only account for a 10% length change.  Researchers theorize that land and marine iguanas evolved from a common ancestor since arriving on the islands from South America, presumably by driftwood. It is thought that the ancestral species inhabited a part of the volcanic archipelago that is now submerged.   A second school of thought holds that the Marine iguana may have evolved from a now extinct family of seagoing reptiles.  Its generic name, Amblyrhynchus, is a combination of two Greek words, Ambly- from Amblus meaning ""blunt"" and rhynchus meaning ""snout"". Its specific name is the Latin word cristatus meaning ""crested,"" and refers to the low crest of spines along the animal's back.  Amblyrhynchus is a monotypic genus in that Amblyrhynchus cristatus is the only species which belongs to it at this point in time.  This species is completely protected under the laws of Ecuador. El Nio effects cause periodic declines in population, with high mortality, and the marine iguana is threatened by predation by exotic species. The total population size is unknown, but is, according to IUCN, at least 50,000, and estimates from the Charles Darwin Research Station are in the hundreds of thousands.  The marine iguanas have not evolved to combat newer predators. Therefore, cats and dogs eat both the young iguanas and dogs will kill adults due to the iguanas' slow reflex times and tameness. Dogs are especially common around human settlements and can cause tremendous predation. Cats are also common in towns, but they also occur in numbers in remote areas where they take a toll on iguanas.  Blue Footed Booby The natural breeding habitat of the Blue-footed Booby (Sula nebouxii) is tropical and subtropical islands off the Pacific Ocean, most famously, the Galpagos Islands, Ecuador. The name booby comes from the Spanish term bobo, which means ""Stupid"" or ""Fool""/""Clown"". This is because the Blue-footed Booby is clumsy on the land. Like other seabirds, they can be very tame. The Blue-footed Booby is on average 81 cm (32) long and weighs 1.5 kilograms (3.3 lb), with the females slightly larger than the males. It has long pointed wings and a wedge shaped tail. They have strong, thick necks. The booby's eyes are placed on either side of their bill and oriented towards the front. They have excellent binocular vision. The Blue-footed Booby's eyes are yellow. The male has more yellow on its iris than the female does. The Blue-footed Booby has permanently closed nostrils specialized for diving. They breathe through the corners of their mouths. Their feet range from a pale turquoise to a deep aquamarine. Males and younger birds have lighter feet than females do. Blue-footed Boobies are distributed among the continental coasts of the eastern Pacific Ocean to the Galapagos Islands and California. The Blue-footed Booby is strictly a marine bird. Their only need for land is to breed, which they do along rocky coasts. The courtship of the Blue-footed Booby consists of the male flaunting his blue feet and dancing to impress the female. During the dance, the male will spread his wings and stamp his feet on the ground. The Blue-footed Booby is a monogamous animal although they do have the potential to be bigamous. They reunite at their breeding grounds. The breeding cycle of the booby is every 8 to 9 months. When mating, the female parades and the male points his head and tail high to the sky and his wings are back to show off to the female. The male blue-footed booby also makes a high-piping whistle noise. Males do a dance to attract the females. The dance includes the males lifting their blue feet high and throwing their heads up. The blue-footed booby is not a seasonally reproducing species. They are opportunistic in their breeding. The female Blue-footed Booby lays two or three eggs. Both male and female take turns incubating the eggs, while the non-sitting bird keeps a watch. Since the Blue-footed Booby does not have a brooding patch (a patch of bare skin on the underbelly) it uses its feet to keep the eggs warm. The chicks cannot control their body temperature up until about one month old. Eggs are laid about 5 days apart. Blue-foots are one of only two species of booby that raise more than one chick. This may be because of the males specialized diving in shallow waters. They must be fed frequently, so the adults constantly hunt for fish. The chicks feed off the regurgitated fish in the adult's mouth. If the parent Blue-footed Booby does not have enough food for all of the chicks, it will only feed the biggest chick, ensuring that at least one will survive. Boobies may use and defend two or three nesting sites until they develop a preference a few weeks before the eggs are laid. Usually 2 to 3 eggs are laid and 1 to 2 chicks are hatched. The incubation period is 4145 days. They nest on bare black lava in a small dip in the ground. The female will turn to face the sun throughout the day so the nest is surrounded by excretion. These nests are done in large colonies. The male and female share quite a bit of their responsibilities. The male will provide food for the young in the first part of their life because of his specialized diving and the female will take over when the demand is higher. The Blue-footed Booby's diet consists entirely of fish. Blue-footed Boobies are specialized fish eaters feeding on school fish like sardines, anchovies, mackerel, and flying fish. They also feed on squid and offal. It dives into the ocean, sometimes from a great height, and swims underwater in pursuit of its prey. It hunts singly, in pairs or in larger flocks. They travel in parties of 12 or so to areas of water with large schools of small fish. When the lead bird sees a fish shoal in the water, it will signal the rest of the group and they will all dive together to catch the fish. Surprisingly, individuals do not eat with the hunting group, preferring to eat on their own, usually in the early morning or late afternoon. When they spot a school they will all dive in unison. They will point their bodies down like a torpedo and dive into the water. Plunge diving can be done from heights of 33-100ft and even up to 330 ft (100 m). These birds hit the water around 60 mph (97 km/h) and can go to depths of 82 ft (25 m) below the water surface. The prey is usually eaten while the bird is still under water. Males and females fish differently which could contribute to the reasons that blue foots, unlike other boobies raise more than one young. The male is smaller and the tail is larger for its body which enables the male to fish in shallow areas instead of just deep waters. The tail can flatten out easier enabling him to change direction in the shallow water. The female is larger and can carry more food. The food is then regurgitated to the young. The males feed the young for the first part of the incubation period. This is done because the males can bring back food quicker than the female. When the demand for more food takes over the female provides the food to the young. Blue-foots will make raucous or polysyllabic grunts or shouts and thin whistle noise. The males of the species have been known to throw up their head and whistle at a female flying by. Their ritual displays are also a form of communication.  Espanola (Suarez Point) Approximately a 10-12 hour trip from Santa Cruz, Espaola is the oldest and the southernmost island in the chain. The trip across open waters can be quite rough especially during August and September. Espaola's remote location helped make it a unique jewel with a large number of endemic creatures. Secluded from the other islands, wildlife on Espaola adapted to the island's environment and natural resources. The subspecies of Marine iguana from Espaola are the only ones that change color during breeding season. Normally, marine iguanas are black in color, a camouflage, making it difficult for predators to differentiate between the iguanas and the black lava rocks where they live. On Espaola adult marine iguanas are brightly colored with a reddish tint except during mating season when their color changes to more of a greenish shade. The Hood Mockingbird is also endemic to the island. These brazen birds have no fear of man and frequently land on visitors heads and shoulders searching for food. The Hood Mockingbird is slightly larger than other mockingbirds found in the Galapagos; its beak is longer and has a more curved shape. The Hood Mockingbird is the only carnivorous one of the species feeding on a variety of insects, turtle hatchlings and sea lion placentas. Wildlife is the highlight of Espaola and the star of the show is the waved albatross. The island's steep cliffs serve as the perfect runways for these large birds which take off for their ocean feeding grounds near the mainland of Ecuador and Peru abandoning the island between January and March. Known as endemic to the island, Espaola is the waved albatross's only nesting place. Each April the males return to Espaola followed shortly thereafter by the females. Mating for life, their ritual begins with the male's annual dance to re-attract his mate. The performance can take up to 5 days consisting of a series of strutting, honking, and beak fencing. Once the pair is reacquainted they produce a single egg and share the responsibility of incubation. The colony remains based on Espaola until December when the chick is fully grown. By January most of the colony leaves the island to fish along the Humboldt Current. Young albatross do not return to Espaola until their 4th or 5th year when they return to seek a mate. Geographically Espaola is a classic example of a shield volcano, created from a single caldera in the center of the island. Over the years as the island has moved further away from the hot spot, the volcano became extinct and erosion began to occur. Espaola's two visitor sites offer an exceptional island visit. Punta Suarez is one of the highlights of the Galapagos Islands. The variety and quantity of wildlife assures a memorable visit. Visitors find migrant, resident, and endemic wildlife including brightly colored Marine Iguanas, Espaola Lava Lizards, Hood Mockingbirds, Swallow Tailed Gulls, Blue Footed and Masked Boobies, Galapagos Hawks, a selection of Finch, and the Waved Albatross.Found on the western tip of Espaola, Punta Suarez offers great wildlife such as sea lions, sea birds and the largest marine iguanas of Galapagos. This is one of the best sites in the Galapagos. The amount of wildlife is overwhelming. Along the beach there are many sea lions and large, colorful lava lizards and marine iguanas. As you follow the trail to the cliff's edge masked boobies can be found nesting among the rock formations. After a short walk down to a beach and back up the other side blue-footed boobies are seen nesting just off the trail. The Galapagos Dove and very friendly Hood Mockingbird are commonly found in this area. The nearby bushes are frequently home to the large-cactus finch, warbler finch, small-ground finch and large-billed flycatcher. Continuing down the trail you come to the only place where waved albatross nest in the islands. Some 12,000 pairs nest on Espaola each year. The feeling is very dramatic and it seems like a desolate wilderness as the waves crash on the jagged cliffs below and the blowhole shoots water 50-70 feet/15-30 meters into the air. The sky above is full of sea birds including red-billed tropicbirds, American Oystercatchers, swallow-tailed gulls, and Audubon's Shearwaters.  Galapagos Islands The Galpagos Islands (official name: Archipilago de Coln; other Spanish names: Islas de Coln or Islas Galpagos) are an archipelago of volcanic islands distributed around the equator in the Pacific Ocean, some 900 km west of Ecuador. It is a UNESCO World Heritage site: wildlife is its most notable feature.  Because of the only very recent arrival of man the majority of the wildlife has no fear of humans and will allow visitors to walk right up them, often having to step over Iguanas or Sea Lions.The Galpagos islands and its surrounding waters are part of a province, a national park, and a biological marine reserve. The principal language on the islands is Spanish. The islands have a population of around 40,000, which is a 40-fold expansion in 50 years.  The islands are geologically young and famed for their vast number of endemic species, which were studied by Charles Darwin during the voyage of the Beagle. His observations and collections contributed to the inception of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection."

I left the biggest project til last - the huge window in the main room where I sleep. It took three stores and a lot of time to assemble all the pieces of the project...when I had them it was finally time to put the vertical blinds out of their misery.  The vertical blinds were so disgusting when I took them down. they hadn't been dusted for ages, and super-size dust bunnies got aaaaaaaall over me (and the floor!). Not to mention I balanced on the edge of my sofa and bed to (carefully!) take them down. It's a miracle I didn't damage the blinds, the house, my body, or anything else.   a word to the wise: have a few swiffers handy when doing a project like this - you never know when the cleaning staff has cut corners. also, take off the blades of the vertical blinds before you store them...it takes some nimble fingers, but it's worth it. That's what I was doing when I took this picture - dismantling the fugly blinds."
