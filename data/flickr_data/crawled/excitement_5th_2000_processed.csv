It was very exciting to have all of our Willows family members join us for our visiting day. We hope you had as much fun as we did.  While the temperature outside continued to rise, so did the fun and excitement. All the children had plenty of water breaks and extra time swimming to keep cool. Even the threat of rain didnt dampen our spirits. We had the opportunity to have an extra special snack of sandwich cookies decorated with icing and jimmies.  This weeks theme was Finding Nemo, and the Tadpoles and Minnows created CD fish door hangers in Camper Creations. At Ceramics, the campers enjoyed painting their clay hands and feet. All your childrens projects will be sent home shortly. On Wednesday, in preparation for Waterworld and to honor our weekly theme of Finding Nemo, many of our Tadpoles and Minnows attempted the giant water slide and loved it.  To end our wonderful week, The Willows campers joined the rest of camp at Waterworld. The children drove water boats and joined in other great water activities. A terrific time was had by all!  We are looking forward to the next four weeks with your children. As a reminder, please remember to label all items brought to camp and wear yellow as much as possible.

We lined up side-by-side, many people thought we were with a newspaper or that we knew something really amazing was just about to take place and they asked what it was and wanted to watch too. I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over. I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol. I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.   Some of the photos might seem a bit strange with the movement/blur but I find them artistic and you can find some interesting pictures within a photo when you let yourself just look without expectations. You may also notice the odd clear face/s that paused in all the movement & excitement. All in all, everyone was having a fantastic time!!

There is nothing like them. Particularly the Alpujarra and Sierra Almijara mountain chains in southern Spain, where I have had the good fortune of spending two months last year farming, climbing, camping, and most memorably, hiking.   Being an Oklahoma girl to the core, I dont really know too much about hiking mountains. I did instinctively understand, however, that mountain hiking makes fantastic allegories for struggles in life. Great orators use mountains as metaphors, mountains are climbed a step at a time . And great gossipers use them as well, I think shes just making a mountain out of a molehill if you ask me But during my time in Spain, I discovered firsthand another lesson mountains can teach you about life: If you are making progress in doing something difficult, usually, it completely sucks.    In my hiking experiences before Spain, (few and far between as they were), I always started said jaunt out very optimistically. Usually it was on trails around Beavers Bend, a breathtaking  State park near my childhood home. Rarely were our hiking adventures well plannedoften we were already in the park swimming or boating around, and just spur of the moment kicked off on a trail. Joyously trotting up the first 100 yards of the path or so, my thoughts were higher than the clouds, What a fantastic day for a little exercise out in nature with my closest friendswhat a beautiful view of that creek/tree/lake, the top will be even more fantastic!...the weather today is just perfect! Shortly after those first 100 yards, my thoughts would begin to sink lower to the ground I was trying to gain, If I can just keep it up a bit longer, maybe we will stop and take a water breakmaybe around the next corner, we will have some downhill stretchessurely the top is not too much further! By the time the hike was half over, every bit of my optimism and joy would be squelched by efforts to keep up with my hiking companions. WHY is this trail so winding? Why doesnt it just go straight up and get it over with?! Ugh. This view is ok. How can it possibly be THIS much better from the top? How come everyone else is so happy? THIS SUCKS! I would look up at my friends or family above me with a giant fake smile to reflect their genuinely happy faces, thinking to myself all the while, I just dont get this. Whats wrong with me? Of course, eventually, we would all reach the top, (me taking up the rear, carrying with me a boatload of fake cheer on my face and grumbly thoughts in my mind.) And of course the view WAS much better than halfway up. Basking in the beautiful vista, the relief of surviving the uphill march with most of my dignity, and the collective satisfaction of our group, all of my mumbles and grumbles evaporated in the sunlight of the mountaintop (or hilltop, in Oklahoma) perch.   The subsequent trip down was always a comparative breeze, and as I floated down the trail, I would ponder back to the uphill portion of the hike, (sometimes only 30 minutes to an hour previous), and wonder, why the heck was that so terrible? I consider myself to be a reasonably fit person, though Im no true athlete, Im certainly not overweight or out of shape.so why was that little jaunt such a mission? Everyone else always seemed to really enjoy it. Usually I concluded that my struggle must have been a circumstantial condition of that particular day. Maybe I didnt get enough sleep the night before. Perhaps I was dehydrated or didnt have a very substantial lunch. I eventually settled upon one of these reasons and as we departed the trail, I left with it the consideration of its struggle. By the time the next hike was suggested, I would have completely forgotten the wailing and gnashing of teeth from the last uphill battle, so I would enthusiastically agree, and this cycle continued for my childhood and into my adult life.   This August, when I decided to spend a couple of months in southern Spain wwoofing, couchsurfing, and generally hoboing around with Billy Silva, this cycle was brought to a sudden and dramatic end.   Before even starting the epic camping trip of 2011, I realized from my experience the last couple of months one thing for sure: I would enjoy the camping, slacklining, goofing around in the mountain streams, picture taking, deep conversat-ing, (thats a word, right?), downhill walking and even some flat trail walking parts of this trip...but the one thing I was worried about was if I would enjoy the uphill portions of our tour. Anxiously I prepared, making sure to get plenty of sleep the night before, increasing my water intake, eating full and balance meals, (and of course plenty of chocolate. A wise lady once told me some people need to be sweetened daily. I figure they especially need to be sweetened if they are about to go on an indefinite uphill hikeparticularly if they are hiking with a boyfriend who appears to love uphill battles and never ever tires.) I did everything to the best of my ability, (just like my papa taught me), and as we started off on the trail, I hoped for the best.   Well.the first 100 yards were pretty freakin great.   After that, you know how the story goes. As the familiar feelings of strain and pain began to set in, I dejectedly evaluated what I could have done wrong. Why wasnt I hauling my butt up these inclines with more gusto? Why wasnt it fun, gosh dangit???  And then. I had an epiphany. Maybe hiking up mountains ISNT fun. Surely no one can possibly actually think its fun to heave oneself up a vertical incline as quickly as possible while carrying everything you need to keep you alive for a couple of days on your back. NO ONE. (Not sane people, anyway. Billy truly seems to love it as evidenced by our hikesI was usually dragging behind considering throwing myself off of the nearest cliff while looking up ahead at his happy, bouncy steps. I swear he practically hopped up mountains like a crazed rabbit. Some people will always be hares. Clearly I am more like a tortoise. Maybe a lizard.) Maybe hikers arent people that like the painful parts of hiking, but instead they are people that like the positives of hiking, the beautiful vistas, the quiet serenity of a mountaintop, the feeling of being so close to a giant blue sky you feel you can stick out your tongue and taste the light bouncing around up there. They like the positives so much, they are willing to pay for them with effort and sweat.  There wasnt anything wrong with me! EVERYONE hates dislikes hauling themselves and heavy stuff up vertical inclines! What an exciting revelation I had on this hiking trip. Hiking basically just sucks. Its awesome to sit on a ledge off the side of a mountain, and the first glimpse of the highest possible vista, priceless, but actually getting there? Not really fun. Everyone gets tired. The person who makes it to the top is the one who figures out how to put it behind them. To climb over it and leave it there until they get to the top and it melts away. Everyone is tired, thats not the point. The point is to keep on climbing.  Maybe if I were more of an athlete by lifestyle, I would have known this about mountains all along. Though from a more abstract perspective, I actually did know it: life has taught me.   In life, there are lots of beautiful ledges from which to view breathtaking vistas, like graduating on the front steps of the Oklahoma State Capitol Building, playing scrabble in Spanish with new Honduran friends on black sand beach, weekend visits to New York City to spend hours wandering around the Lower East Side and having brunch with old best friends, watching my mother chase my little sister around the kitchen with a broom in excitement after a surprise homecoming for Thanksgiving, watching lizards,  teaching an deployed American soldier to two-step to Kenyan disco music in the break of the Indian ocean, and of course, mid-May bikerides from Stonewall to a friends front porch at 2 am. Lucky for me my life has been packed with those moments. But life is more than ledges, it has its fair share of actual climbing. Spending all day and half of the night in Edmond Lowe Library, classes with professors that suck at teaching and dont care, holding a friends hand as she tells you her nightmares knowing you dont know what to say but must hold her hand as tight as you can anyway, doctors visits, sorting numerical data for research projects, washing dishes, weeding. Life just aint easybut anything worth having is worth working hard for. Any mountain worth climbing is worth the hike.   And this thought finds me here, in my last semester at Oklahoma State University. Close to reaching a summit of graduation from undergraduate life in May. Struggling with my usual mountain climbing questions to which, deeply, I know the answer: Why am I doing this? Why is the trail so winding? Could the view possibly be better from here? Its uncomfortable to keep hiking, but thats the only thing to do. Keep cranking out papers, keep studying for tests, and, (for heavens sake!) keep going to class. Ill definitely have a couple of 2am bike rides thrown in there, for now those can be my cairns of life, but I cant forget I am on my way to the summit. I have to keep moving vertically. The view from the top is worth it.  See you on the other side of the next one."

I spent NYE on Granville St in Vancouver BC with two other fantastic photographers capturing the fun of the evening. We lined up side-by-side, many people thought we were with a newspaper or that we knew something really amazing was just about to take place and they asked what it was and wanted to watch too. I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over. I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol. I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.   Some of the photos might seem a bit strange with the movement/blur but I find them artistic and you can find some interesting pictures within a photo when you let yourself just look without expectations. You may also notice the odd clear face/s that paused in all the movement & excitement. All in all, everyone was having a fantastic time!!  If you see yourself in any of the pictures on my Facebook page, please tag yourself and then share the photos to your friends & family. If you like my page then you will get notified for when I post the rest of the pictures which are coming soon! www.facebook.com/AnnaHallPhotographer  Thank YOU for posing for me and bringing such great energy to NYE!!"

Stewart, Georgia-March 29, 2013)  Family fun was the well-received mandate for Soldiers of Fort Stewarts Warriors in Transition Battalion (WTB) Friday at the bases WTB Soldier Family Assistance Center (SFAC). The quarterly event, sponsored by the Ft. Stewart Army Community Services division, presented a variety of activities for families including face painting, charades, egg hunting, hula hooping and good eats; all free of charge. Our (military) families deserve to have a variety of fun options, said Linda Boitey, the centers Outreach Coordinator. The responsibility to our wounded, ill and injured Soldiers does not end with services for them; it begins at the core of what makes our Soldiers strong  their families! The games encouraged children to use critical thinking skills and team strategy development with the biggest benefit being the smiles. The non-stop action of the evening brought an unusual transformation of sorts.  The faces of the children and adults began to reveal what instinct fueled their spirit of resiliency.  Pandas, lions, comic book characters came to life with the help of WTB wife Julia Bethunes face painting.  The bright colors covered their faces but nothing could camouflage their enjoyment!  Bethune says the gift of grinning has its own healing benefits.  We are all in this together, Bethune said, cracking open another bright color to the excitement of a youngster.  You can wait for someone to bring the fun to you but sharing a laugh is what makes our family team work. (U.S. Army Photo by Staff Sgt. Tracy J. Smith) "

Cannibaldubbed the King of Horror Burlesquereturns one more time to present THE THIRTEENTH AND FINAL CHAPTER in his gruesome banquet of midnight mayhem!   After 7 long years of silence local cult band Reverend Glasseye returns as a shaken and somber beast to kick off this frightful night of fun! Emerging in the 90s as one of the originators of the East coast's dark cabaret movement, the band solidified its place on the scene with its junk aesthetic and operatic bravadocombining American and East European folk music to eventually win Boston's Rock and Roll Rumble in 2005. Now Reverend Glasseye finally slouches again toward Bostonand with a return to its folk roots, the band has created a sound that is leaner and darker than ever! Following their set will be a bevy of grotesque burlesque courtesy of the infamous horror troupe, Black Cat Burlesque. Dedicated to putting the BUMP back into the night, Black Cat Burlesque has been raising pulses, the dead and a whole lot of hell since 2003. As the bad seeds of Boston Burlesque, this scream team mines the depths of their twisted psychesblending striptease thrills and spookshow chills to push the boundaries of the art form and explore the dark, cobwebbed corners of neo-cabaret.  For the nights feature, Mr. Cannibal has hand-picked Peter Jackson's perversely comic BAD TASTE, screening on 35 mm film!

Cannibal, is a celebration of all things terrifying. The Improper Bostonian Think Rocky Horror Picture Show with less androgyny and more anthropophagy.

The festival is also known as the Tesagan Gin Je or the Nine Emperor Gods Festival.  This festival is filled with tradition and excitement.  Most of the people taking part in the festival are of Chinese heritage, 30% of the population in Thailand.  The festival started in 1825 when a Chinese circus act came to town and a sickness broke out amongst the artists.  They healed themselves by following a strict vegetarian diet.  These days the festival is a VERY exciting event full of surprises and amazing photo opportunities.  If you havent experienced something like this before, brace yourself. "

Landrake Moto Parc was founded in 1995 and is set in 25 acres of beautiful Cornish countryside, with the track taking approximately half of the site - the rest for paddock area and spectator parking. We also have another 10 acres for additional parking for the very large events. The track is 1900km long and is a minimum of 10 metres wide with some sections 15 metres wide and sits in a valley with trees on one side. With features such as a whoop section, raised berms, ski-ramps, step-downs and step-ups, and a laptime of over two minutes, exhilarating racing is ensured. 40 GP-standard start gates lead you to a 110 metre start straight, turning out into a wide downhill and then a chicane - followed by a very popular feature with spectators immediately in front of the pits - a table-top suitable for laying down some whips and scrubs, with a 100 foot tabletop right after! All this with superb viewing for specatators.   Whilst the track is fast and flowing, its a very technical track, with some old-school features such as adverse cambers and natural terrain, combined with some man-made jumps, along with a rythm section to add to the excitement for riders and spectators alike. So, riders need sublime skills to get a winning lap here.

I spent NYE on Granville St in Vancouver BC with two other fantastic photographers capturing the fun of the evening. We lined up side-by-side, many people thought we were with a newspaper or that we knew something really amazing was just about to take place and they asked what it was and wanted to watch too. I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over. I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol. I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.   Some of the photos might seem a bit strange with the movement/blur but I find them artistic and you can find some interesting pictures within a photo when you let yourself just look without expectations. You may also notice the odd clear face/s that paused in all the movement & excitement. All in all, everyone was having a fantastic time!!  If you see yourself in any of the pictures on my Facebook page, please tag yourself and then share the photos to your friends & family. If you like my page then you will get notified for when I post the rest of the pictures which are coming soon! www.facebook.com/AnnaHallPhotographer  Thank YOU for posing for me and bringing such great energy to NYE!!"

This here is a photograph of my little cousin Naba , who came to Bangladesh with my aunt few weeks back to pay us a visit . They are currently residing in Italy . So they stayed at our place for two weeks , and these two weeks were amazing and her presence made it even better . During these two weeks of their stay , there was not a single day when I saw her sad . She had been ecstatic all the time , played madly with the other cousins who came over . So one morning , she came to my room and was staring at my walls very keenly . That night she asked me , where do I keep the wings and asked me if I could fly . I replied with a smile "" Everyone has their wings , and every one can fly in their dreams "" . The walls she was staring at consisted of some of my artworks and one of them was of my twin sister with the angelic wings . The day before they left , she came to me and asked "" Can I ask for something ? ""  . I said ""yes dear anything you want"" , then she said with great excitement "" I also want those wings , I also want to fly "" . I said ""Sure you can have them , but remember you can only see yourself flying while you're asleep"" and then she said "" Nessun problema, sto bene con quello! "" , I asked her what that means and she said "" It means , no problem I'm fine with that "" . That very night , I also took some photographs of her .  She seemed euphoric like she always does and last night I showed her the picture , she was extremely happy .   If there is one thing that I learned from her , it would be how to be in Euphoria with the little things you have . Her departure saddens me at times , but whenever I look at this photograph I feel Euphoric and this is something that I would want to cherish !

While the temperature outside continued to rise, so did the fun and excitement. All the children had plenty of water breaks and extra time swimming to keep cool. Even the threat of rain didnt dampen our spirits. We had the opportunity to have an extra special snack of sandwich cookies decorated with icing and jimmies.  This weeks theme was Finding Nemo, and the Tadpoles and Minnows created CD fish door hangers in Camper Creations. At Ceramics, the campers enjoyed painting their clay hands and feet. All your childrens projects will be sent home shortly. On Wednesday, in preparation for Waterworld and to honor our weekly theme of Finding Nemo, many of our Tadpoles and Minnows attempted the giant water slide and loved it.  To end our wonderful week, The Willows campers joined the rest of camp at Waterworld. The children drove water boats and joined in other great water activities. A terrific time was had by all!  We are looking forward to the next four weeks with your children. As a reminder, please remember to label all items brought to camp and wear yellow as much as possible.

Landrake Moto Parc was founded in 1995 and is set in 25 acres of beautiful Cornish countryside, with the track taking approximately half of the site - the rest for paddock area and spectator parking. We also have another 10 acres for additional parking for the very large events. The track is 1900km long and is a minimum of 10 metres wide with some sections 15 metres wide and sits in a valley with trees on one side. With features such as a whoop section, raised berms, ski-ramps, step-downs and step-ups, and a laptime of over two minutes, exhilarating racing is ensured. 40 GP-standard start gates lead you to a 110 metre start straight, turning out into a wide downhill and then a chicane - followed by a very popular feature with spectators immediately in front of the pits - a table-top suitable for laying down some whips and scrubs, with a 100 foot tabletop right after! All this with superb viewing for specatators.   Whilst the track is fast and flowing, its a very technical track, with some old-school features such as adverse cambers and natural terrain, combined with some man-made jumps, along with a rythm section to add to the excitement for riders and spectators alike.

She also likes climbing on podiums and would probably enjoy some light, fun agility. Kia would be good in any loving family. She really gets along with anyone.  A couple weeks ago I volunteered at PAWS Atlanta. I took photos of some of the dogs and cats that need homes. I thought I'd also remind people you can find great pets at shelters and in rescue groups. And of course, help control the pet population, please spay and neuter your pets!!"

We love digging through the vendor tables looking for great deals, and we love how they bring a sense of fun and community to our city's neighbourhoods. So we are pleased to have Chris Roberts and Brigid Elmy, founders of the Leslieville Flea, as guest bloggers. They'll be writing regularly for us in the future, but first, we talked to Chris about were their passion for upcycling came from and why they started the Leslieville Flea.  I grew up hanging around in my dads workshop. While most girls my age were playing with dolls, I was turning wood on the lathe and putting metal plumbing parts together to make sculptures. Theres never been a dumpster I could pass without looking insidejust ask my husband about the time I hauled some old moldings home while seven months pregnant! I hate to see things end up in a landfill and think theres so much potential in things people throw out. thats how my business Shes Crafty came about. I use old doors, windows, and salvaged wood and cast off items to upcycle and create something new and beautiful.  My business partner Brigid Elmy shares a similar love of upcycling. While working as a project manager for a large educational institution she began on weekends to re-imagine salvaged pieces of wood, metal and other objects into functional pieces of furniture and her business Objektkul was born. Working with select craftspeople she enjoys the process of bringing an idea to fruition.  With upcycling as our foundation, Brigid and I began to seek out solutions to maximize our potential reach and customer base. It occurred to us that there must be many other artists, craftspeople, collectors and creators out there looking to do the same. And that's how The Leslieville Flea was born!  After much searching we found a location that would work. The marketing engine was turned on and we began to spread the good word.  Applications from vendors came pouring in and we quickly realized that there was a huge need for this type of market in the East End.  There is a real trend towards people embracing vintage and handmade items. They satisfy a sense of nostalgia and the desire to find something truly original for yourself or your home right now. I think people are also realizing the huge value in vintage and handcrafted goodsboth sentimental and in the quality of the items.  We love to help people find that one thing that resonates with them. Several customers have emailed us looking for something in particular and with a resource of over 50 vendors we can help them find it at the Flea.   So many people have visited The Leslieville Flea and commented on how it has really made the neighbourhood and Torontoeven more vibrant. Its a fun outing and people look forward to it each month.    With the weather getting colder weve moved indoors for the winter...our November 17th and December 15th Fleas will be held at The Jimmy Simpson Rec Center at 870 Queen Street East. We will have even more vendors and will have 10 food vendors to satisfy your hunger from all that shopping!  In addition to running the Flea, Brigid and I are working on a story for an upcomingCovet Garden post about Holiday Decorating with Vintage Finds. There are so many great ideas with these one of a kind items! We are looking forward to sharing it with you and being part of Covet Garden as regular guest bloggers.  The Leslieville community and city as a whole have supported and welcomed us and we feel truly privileged to work with all of the fantastic vendors at the Leslieville Flea whose passion is contagious! We have such a great time interacting with all the Flea-goersits a really fun and happy vibe and weve met the best people! There is an excitement in the air about that great item they just found, or that amazing deal someone just got. Its the thrill of the find and it never gets old!  In the meantime, stay in touch with us at www.leslievilleflea.com for all the news on the Flea!  p.s. The Covet Garden team will be selling copies of Covet Garden Home, our hot-off-the-presses print edition at the December 15th Leslieville Flea! Come out and say 'hi'!"

About New swing sextet, New York oldest Vibe driven sextet, and still performing ""salsa that keeps the dancers moving and the Dj's pumping"" Biography ABOUT THE NEW SWING SEXTET A product of New York City and the excitement and turbulence of the sixties, the New Swing Sextet made its professional debut performing in the Singer Bowl at the last New York Worlds Fair in 1965... The band has been a popular and innovative exponent of Latin jazz, salsa and pop music for nearly four decades. Composed of vocals, piano, vibes, bass and Latin percussion, the original New Swing broke up in the late seventies after successfully recording, touring and doing all the hot club dates that the New York metropolitan area had to offer. In recent years most of the groups core members have reunited and have been performing with Mambo Negro the highly popular Latin jazz ensemble, which performs regularly in and around the tri-state area. However, you can't buy or replace 40 years of history, and on special occasions the band performs as the New Swing. The New Swing offers an established and respected name with a sound from another era, which has been perfectly preserved and bottled for another generation to enjoy. The band was part of a young crop (and new breed of aspiring Latin musicians) who grew up in the greater New York Metropolitan tri-state area with its rich ethnic mix and diverse inner-city culture, while at the same time growing up surrounded by the Latin music explosion happening in the region. The Palladium and other clubs were dancing to the music of Machito and his Afro-Cubans, and the Jose Curbelo Orchestra while Tito Puente, Tito Rodriguez, Eddie Palmieri, Joe Cuba, and Cal Tjader, among many others, had already established their unmistakable sounds. In the early sixties, every other city block in New York had a Latin band and a doo-wop group. Blend these many elements together and you get the influences that shaped the New Swing Sextet and their contemporaries, including Johnny Colon; the Lebron Brothers; Willie Colon, Joe Bataan and Pete Rodriguez groups that helped pioneer a new street sound (which would eventually become Latin Boogaloo and Salsa). The New Swing Sextet would join the Alpha Artists of America (under the Management of Jose Curbelo) and ultimately record 4 long albums (and have a separate Best of the New Swing Sextet) all under the Cotique label. The band regularly performed on popular TV shows such as El Club de la Juventud con Polito Vega; The Tito Puente Show with host Sofi; and El Show de Myrta Silva among others. It was a magical time to be a performing Latin artist in New York City. A fraternity of great musicians and legends in the making, routinely performing together at the great dance clubs of the day, including: The Corso; LaMaganette; The Chez Jose; La Mancha; The Colgate Gardens; The Psycho Room; The Tropicoro; The Cheetah and at all the great battle of the band venues such as The Hunts Point Palace; The Manhattan Center; The Riverside Plaza Hotel and The St. Georges Hotel. Over a ten-year period the New Swing performed all summer-long at popular resorts and at the summer home of Latin music: las Villas. The band has also toured extensively and performed at world famous venues such as the legendary Apollo Theatre; the South Street Seaport and Webster Hall in New York City. Recent performances to large audiences in Montreal, San Francisco, & Los Angeles, proved that the band still has plenty of sabrosura to keep the dancers on the floor. (read less)"

I spent NYE on Granville St in Vancouver BC with two other fantastic photographers capturing the fun of the evening. We lined up side-by-side, many people thought we were with a newspaper or that we knew something really amazing was just about to take place and they asked what it was and wanted to watch too. I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over. I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol. I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.   Some of the photos might seem a bit strange with the movement/blur but I find them artistic and you can find some interesting pictures within a photo when you let yourself just look without expectations. You may also notice the odd clear face/s that paused in all the movement & excitement. All in all, everyone was having a fantastic time!!

For the first time, drivers explore new competitive kart possibilities, such as soaring through the skies or plunging into the depths of the sea. New courses, strategic new abilities and customizable karts bring the racing excitement to new heights.  FEATURES:      The Mario Kart franchise continues to evolve. New kart abilities add to the wild fun that the games are known for. On big jumps, a kart deploys a wing to let it glide over the track shortcut. When underwater, a propeller pops out to help the kart cruise across the sea floor.      Players can show their own style by customizing their vehicles with accessories that give them a competitive advantage. For instance, giant tires help a kart drive off-road, while smaller tires accelerate quickly on paved courses.      People can choose to race as one of their favorite Mushroom Kingdom characters or even as their Mii character.      New courses take players on wild rides over mountains, on city streets and through a dusty desert. Nintendo fans will recognize new courses on Wuhu Island and in the jungles from Donkey Kong Country Returns.      The game supports both SpotPass and StreetPass features.      Players can compete in local wireless matches or online over a broadband Internet connection."

There was personal redemption, too, for Carli Lloyd, who answered her missed kick in that 3-1 shootout loss by scoring a goal in each half to seal the Olympic crown for her nation.  Japan were dubbed the Barcelona of the women's game for their flurry of neat passing and slick movement and their average height of 5ft 4in compared to the US's 5ft 7in. The Americans were the big tournament specialists. This was the fifth women's Olympic final and USA were continuing their record of being in all of them, losing only to Norway at Sydney 2000, 3-2.  For Japan, their coach Norio Sasaki framed the attempted conquest of gold as part of the country's healing process, following the trauma of last year's earthquake which killed nearly 20,000 people.  Ahead of this final he said: ""All the Japanese people are still trying to come back from the earthquake disaster.  ""Winning the World Cup was very emotional last year and gave energy to the nation after what had happened and the same can happen again.""  After eight minutes a noisy, though not completely filled Wembley, witnessed the opening strike. Tobin Heath galloped into space down the left before Alex Morgan's twist and cross was met by Carli Lloyd, just ahead of the 143-goal Abby Wambach.  Far from being unsettled, Japan went in search of an instant reply. A shot from Nahomi Kawasumi was blocked by the USA captain, Christie Rampone, with Hope Solo, the keeper, stranded. Yuki Ogimi followed up but could not convert.  Ogimi went closer moments later. A hanging jump was followed by the forward's header being superbly palmed onto the bar b y Solo.  The goal-frame proved an extra defender for both sides. Amy LePeilbet's cross was met with a glancing header by Rampone that hit Yuki Fukomoto's right post. At the opposite end, Aya Miyama's pile-driver smashed back off the bar.  Ogimi was instrumental in every Japan attack. Her lay-off nine minutes from half-time was hit with a menacing curl by Shinobu Ohno but the ball was marginally wide of the post.  The open, entertaining nature of this contest continued after the break. Japan spread the ball across midfield only for their attacks to founder due to a belief deficit. When given sight of goal  as Miyama, the captain, on 52 minutes  the opportunity was snatched at.  When America flooded forward there was menace. After Megan Rapinoe laid the ball into Lloyd, she surged from near half-way then unloaded a 20-yard humdinger that gave the 5ft 4in keeper Fukumoto no chance, and that was 2-0 to Pia Sunhage's team.  In the 63nd minute Japan's Ogimi raised the excitement scale to fevered after her strike, though this proved a consolation as the neat triangles that were ending in cul-de-sacs continued to frustrate the Japanese.  The world champions still had their chances but when Miyama had two free-kicks to deliver in quick succession, her side failed to profit."

Updates - Egypt, June 30, 2013**  The second wave of the revolution has started! June 30 began as a much bigger movement than January 25. After a majority of Egyptians were fed up with Muslim Brotherhood rule they took their decision and lead the politicians to the street.  June 30 made a great start with millions of people revolting in almost all governorates of Egypt. With red cards and whistles, Egypt declared Morsi out. Rules were put for the protesters to never chant for or against the army or the police, but when a military helicopter started flying over Ithadeya many cheered for it. The loudest chant though was ""LEAVE"", all protesters united on one aim, to topple the Islamist fascist regime.  Meanwhile a few clashes between the regime supporters and revolutionaries took place in Assuyt and Beheira, leaving at least five dead and around 80 injured. In Cairo, the clashes were in front of the Muslim Brotherhood headquarters in Mokkatam where supporters fired bird-shot from the building and where met with Molotov cocktails from the protesters resulting in small fires inside the building.  June 29, 2013**  The Egyptian People did one final warm up before the Red Card comes out. Tamarod Movement (Rebel) held a press conference early Saturday at the Journalists Syndicate, the movement's founder announced that the final count was more than 22 million signatures. He called upon the people to protest on June 30 to continue what they started and topple the first civilian elected president one year after his inauguration for his failure in achieving the main objectives of the January 25 Revolution as well as putting the Muslim Brotherhood in control of the top of power of all country's sides of power. He also asserted that the number of signatures was a reflection of how much the public has turned against Morsi. It is noteworthy that the number of signatures collected is more than 85% of the number of voters in the presidential elections' second round. Egyptians took their decision and raised the red card against President Mohamed Morsi!  Egypt, June 28, 2013**  As Egypt approaches June 30, the date of the uprising called for by Tamarod (Rebel), a movement that has already collected more than 22 million signatures to ouster President Mohamed Morsi, both excitement and apprehension fill the residents of the capital. In the governorates though, the protests have started earlier than expected. On the day of the governors' reshuffling people took the streets in all governorates that had a new Muslim Brotherhood governor. As the protests became bigger they have also demanded the removal of the regime.  In the past year, the life of the average Egyptian has become harder everyday; prices of essential products never seize to increase, people had to stand in endless lines to find diesel, every house and workplace all over Cairo suffer from water and power cuts. All this lead to rising aggression between a great percentage of the population. Anger was dramatically increased when Egypt ran out of gas and the streets of Cairo turned into one big parking lot.  By the beginning of the week, it has become known that Ann Patterson, U.S. Ambassador to Egypt met with Khairat El Shater, deputy supreme guide of the Muslim Brotherhood. The meeting with a non-governmental-official was never explained by the embassy, but it has become clear that the U.S. Administration still supports the Muslim Brotherhood rule, and President Morsi as part of it. The U.S. Administration that has always claimed to encourage democratic change in developing countries, proved itself wrong after the Arab Spring. It is now understood that the American support is always given to a group whom they believe will give them the most benefit regardless of the group's view on people's freedom. For this reason, a new addition to the revolution's banners was ones against Obama, Patterson and the U.S. Administration in general.  The Defense Minister, Abd El Fattah El Sisi has been very discreet about his stance regarding the Muslim Brotherhood rule. On Sunday he gave a vague speech that has kept people wondering if we'll be facing a coup in the coming days, especially when he mentioned that the army's role is to protect the will of the people. One day after the minister has spoken a National Security Council meeting was announced. The meeting's statement expressed the attendees' respect to peaceful protests and declared that the parliamentary elections will be held in a few months, once the elections law is approved. The presidency has also announced that the president will give a speech on Wednesday to celebrate the first anniversary of his inauguration.  Tamarod met the announcement of the president's speech with calling for a protest to watch him in Tahrir Square. After the whole country waited in front of a television, Morsi spoke for almost three hours saying complete nonsense. The speech that had not once mentioned June 30 or the clashes that were happening in Mansoura a few hours before he spoke, had one aim; to show that the army and police are on the side of the regime. This was proven, from the president's opinion, after both ministers of Defense and Interior were present in the front row listening to his speech, and after mentioning five times that he's the commander-in-chief of the police and armed forces.  Two days before the revolution, the plan was to mobilize all governorates but Greater Cairo's. Today what actually happened was that there were protests in almost every city and village in Egypt. While Alexandria, Dakahleya, Port Said, Dameitta, Monofeya, Gharbeya, Sharqeya and Beni Souief had huge protests, Greater Cairo had four sit-ins for the first time since January 25, 2011. As protesters poured in in Tahrir Square, others stayed in Kitkat in Giza, and others in front of the Ministry of Defense. A warm up has started with two small sit-ins in the vicinity of the Presidential Palace in Heliopolis. The day has faced clashes in many cities between revolutionaries and regime supporters that left two dead, one of which is an American citizen, and 227 injured.  **Text by: Mariam Saleh (mariam-saleh.blogspot.com)"

All your childrens projects will be sent home shortly. On Wednesday, in preparation for Waterworld and to honor our weekly theme of Finding Nemo, many of our Tadpoles and Minnows attempted the giant water slide and loved it.

The Army gave the Soldiers the day off so they could be part of the Super Bowl XLVII excitement and see it all live, even though theyre stationed half a world away. There was also plenty of food  free breakfasts at Area I clubs, an all-you-can-eat deal at the Camp Casey food court, as well as prize drawings for TV sets, i-Pads and other giveaways. For Soldiers and families stationed in Korea, catching the telecast live from the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans meant showing up early, with on-post facilities opening their doors at six. Free breakfast  eggs, grits, creamed beef, biscuits, bacon, sausage, hash browns, coffee, juice   awaited them at a variety of on-post facilities: at the Gateway Club and Warriors Club on Camp Casey, the Iron Triangle on Camp Hovey, Reggies on Camp Stanley, and Mitchells Community Club and Conference Center on Camp Red Cloud.  That was followed later in the morning by still more food  at Mitchells, for example, hot wings, fried wings and hot dogs; at the Gateway, three kinds of pizza   pepperoni, sausage, cheese  the spread varied somewhat from club to club. And the Camp Casey Food Court drew a Super Bowl crowd of its own  about 230 people, offering all-you-can-eat for $11.99, for which patrons could order continually from the eateries of their choice. Soldiers said they were glad for the live game, the food and the chance to socialize with their battle buddies. I think its generous cause its not a given, its a privilege, Pvt. Luis Campos, a Ravens fan with the 552nd Signal Company, said of being given the day off to watch the game. For them doing that, it takes the stress off the Soldiers, especially us being overseas and stuff. Everybody back home, they get a chance to watch the game. So now we get the privilege and stuff, so it makes it better. I really appreciate it, especially being here in Korea, said Spc. Austin Ross of Company B, Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, 2nd Infantry Division. Ross had been pulling for the 49ers. Had there not been the Super Bowl holiday, Ross would have been at work. Its in the morning, itd be during work, and its something American that I get to do here in Korea. I appreciate it, he said. This is great, said Sgt. 1st Class Randy Waits, a motor sergeant and 49ers fan with Headquarters Support Company, Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, 2nd Infantry Division. Its great the way they provide the opportunity for the Soldiers to see this and be able to come together, be overseas, away from our families. Just like a holiday. Being able to come together and socialize."

About New swing sextet, New York oldest Vibe driven sextet, and still performing ""salsa that keeps the dancers moving and the Dj's pumping"" Biography ABOUT THE NEW SWING SEXTET A product of New York City and the excitement and turbulence of the sixties, the New Swing Sextet made its professional debut performing in the Singer Bowl at the last New York Worlds Fair in 1965... The band has been a popular and innovative exponent of Latin jazz, salsa and pop music for nearly four decades. Composed of vocals, piano, vibes, bass and Latin percussion, the original New Swing broke up in the late seventies after successfully recording, touring and doing all the hot club dates that the New York metropolitan area had to offer. In recent years most of the groups core members have reunited and have been performing with Mambo Negro the highly popular Latin jazz ensemble, which performs regularly in and around the tri-state area. However, you can't buy or replace 40 years of history, and on special occasions the band performs as the New Swing. The New Swing offers an established and respected name with a sound from another era, which has been perfectly preserved and bottled for another generation to enjoy. The band was part of a young crop (and new breed of aspiring Latin musicians) who grew up in the greater New York Metropolitan tri-state area with its rich ethnic mix and diverse inner-city culture, while at the same time growing up surrounded by the Latin music explosion happening in the region. The Palladium and other clubs were dancing to the music of Machito and his Afro-Cubans, and the Jose Curbelo Orchestra while Tito Puente, Tito Rodriguez, Eddie Palmieri, Joe Cuba, and Cal Tjader, among many others, had already established their unmistakable sounds. In the early sixties, every other city block in New York had a Latin band and a doo-wop group. Blend these many elements together and you get the influences that shaped the New Swing Sextet and their contemporaries, including Johnny Colon; the Lebron Brothers; Willie Colon, Joe Bataan and Pete Rodriguez groups that helped pioneer a new street sound (which would eventually become Latin Boogaloo and Salsa). The New Swing Sextet would join the Alpha Artists of America (under the Management of Jose Curbelo) and ultimately record 4 long albums (and have a separate Best of the New Swing Sextet) all under the Cotique label. The band regularly performed on popular TV shows such as El Club de la Juventud con Polito Vega; The Tito Puente Show with host Sofi; and El Show de Myrta Silva among others. It was a magical time to be a performing Latin artist in New York City. A fraternity of great musicians and legends in the making, routinely performing together at the great dance clubs of the day, including: The Corso; LaMaganette; The Chez Jose; La Mancha; The Colgate Gardens; The Psycho Room; The Tropicoro; The Cheetah and at all the great battle of the band venues such as The Hunts Point Palace; The Manhattan Center; The Riverside Plaza Hotel and The St. Georges Hotel. Over a ten-year period the New Swing performed all summer-long at popular resorts and at the summer home of Latin music: las Villas. The band has also toured extensively and performed at world famous venues such as the legendary Apollo Theatre; the South Street Seaport and Webster Hall in New York City. Recent performances to large audiences in Montreal, San Francisco, & Los Angeles, proved that the band still has plenty of sabrosura to keep the dancers on the floor. (read less)"

For more information look at www.baytobirdwood.com.au/the_run.html  I got to the grounds early (about 6am) and watched the oval fill from nothing. 1800 cars were expected for the biggest event of this type in the world.   From the website ""The sun will not yet have risen over the Adelaide Hills when the very first vehicles start arriving at Adelaide Shores. It may only be 6am but the excitement will already be palpable as these marvellous veteran, vintage and early classic vehicles ready themselves for the biennial Bay to Birdwood Run.

Vehicles head down West Beach Road after the official Start turning right into Tapleys Hill Road then left into Anzac Highway.

""Only those motor vehicles built and at ready for sale stage on or before 31 December 1955 are eligible to take part.

All motor vehicles must be substantially to manufacturers' specifications, roadworthy and of acceptable standard of quality in the opinion of the Committee.""  I enjoyed the ride. We passed many broken down cars whilst gliding along in my fathers Jowett Javelin.   We ended up in the fields behind the Birdwood Mill. We looked through the muesum and also the best dressed cars in the Concours d'Elegance. We listened to period music and poked about amongst the cars.  Canon EOS 5D, 24-70.  2012  Img_8021"

There was personal redemption, too, for Carli Lloyd, who answered her missed kick in that 3-1 shootout loss by scoring a goal in each half to seal the Olympic crown for her nation.  Japan were dubbed the Barcelona of the women's game for their flurry of neat passing and slick movement and their average height of 5ft 4in compared to the US's 5ft 7in. The Americans were the big tournament specialists. This was the fifth women's Olympic final and USA were continuing their record of being in all of them, losing only to Norway at Sydney 2000, 3-2.  For Japan, their coach Norio Sasaki framed the attempted conquest of gold as part of the country's healing process, following the trauma of last year's earthquake which killed nearly 20,000 people.  Ahead of this final he said: ""All the Japanese people are still trying to come back from the earthquake disaster.  ""Winning the World Cup was very emotional last year and gave energy to the nation after what had happened and the same can happen again.""  After eight minutes a noisy, though not completely filled Wembley, witnessed the opening strike. Tobin Heath galloped into space down the left before Alex Morgan's twist and cross was met by Carli Lloyd, just ahead of the 143-goal Abby Wambach.  Far from being unsettled, Japan went in search of an instant reply. A shot from Nahomi Kawasumi was blocked by the USA captain, Christie Rampone, with Hope Solo, the keeper, stranded. Yuki Ogimi followed up but could not convert.  Ogimi went closer moments later. A hanging jump was followed by the forward's header being superbly palmed onto the bar b y Solo.  The goal-frame proved an extra defender for both sides. Amy LePeilbet's cross was met with a glancing header by Rampone that hit Yuki Fukomoto's right post. At the opposite end, Aya Miyama's pile-driver smashed back off the bar.  Ogimi was instrumental in every Japan attack. Her lay-off nine minutes from half-time was hit with a menacing curl by Shinobu Ohno but the ball was marginally wide of the post.  The open, entertaining nature of this contest continued after the break. Japan spread the ball across midfield only for their attacks to founder due to a belief deficit. When given sight of goal  as Miyama, the captain, on 52 minutes  the opportunity was snatched at.  When America flooded forward there was menace. After Megan Rapinoe laid the ball into Lloyd, she surged from near half-way then unloaded a 20-yard humdinger that gave the 5ft 4in keeper Fukumoto no chance, and that was 2-0 to Pia Sunhage's team.  In the 63nd minute Japan's Ogimi raised the excitement scale to fevered after her strike, though this proved a consolation as the neat triangles that were ending in cul-de-sacs continued to frustrate the Japanese.  The world champions still had their chances but when Miyama had two free-kicks to deliver in quick succession, her side failed to profit."

I spent NYE on Granville St in Vancouver BC with two other fantastic photographers capturing the fun of the evening. We lined up side-by-side, many people thought we were with a newspaper or that we knew something really amazing was just about to take place and they asked what it was and wanted to watch too. I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over. I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol. I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.   Some of the photos might seem a bit strange with the movement/blur but I find them artistic and you can find some interesting pictures within a photo when you let yourself just look without expectations. You may also notice the odd clear face/s that paused in all the movement & excitement. All in all, everyone was having a fantastic time!!  If you see yourself in any of the pictures on my Facebook page, please tag yourself and then share the photos to your friends & family.

Even the most diehard athletes and boosters would be hard-pressed, however, to match the intensity and staying power of the fund-raising efforts backing Holmes Desmelik and Amber Rhodes.  Visit Brevard High School any day of the week to observe ""Holmes Team"" and ""Amber's Angels"" fervently chasing their goals on behalf of these fellow students.  Both Amber and Holmes suffer from cancers which cannot be fully eradicated (if at all) through surgery.  In honor of both students, Blue Devils purchased headbands for a dollar apiece, then gathered on October 9th for a star-shaped photo to honor the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation.  In the end, that first wave raised over $1,200 for the teams (see our album).  Graphics teacher Katrina Ronneburger (BHS) said, ""I wanted to help my students come up with a way they could show support for Amber Rhodes - a senior from BHS - and Holmes - whose mother Clare teaches Spanish at BHS. Both of these families have a child that's been diagnosed with a brain tumor. We came up with 'Headbands 4 Hope,' and my students jumped all over it!   ""The campaign was run through my club (BHS Graphics Club) We sold almost 100 the 1st day without any promotion. My students made posters to put all over school - and it went crazy from there.  ""Several students made generous donations and only expected one headband, others bought $20 worth to pass out to friends. We did have several anonymous donations to raise our final total to $1200.00. We donated $600 to the Desmelik family and $600 to 'Make-A-Wish' for Amber's Team.""  Clare Desmelik added, ""Thanks for showing support for our families.  Holmes was diagnosed with a tumor in his thalamus, which most doctors consider inoperable.  Right now his tumor is stable and Holmes is enjoying kindergarten. He is a great little guy with a heart of gold.  One of his goals for this year is to make a green stamp for good behavior every single day at school and not to have to get a warning from his teachers.  ""There has been an incredible amount of love and support pouring in from the community.  Our friends and Holmes' friends, many churches and small businesses have all been so generous.  I am so blessed to work in such a wonderful school system.  The folks at TCS have overwhelmed us with support.  Faculty from all of the schools have reached out, as well as the good people at the Central Office.  BHS had our back from the very first day that our world changed with his diagnosis.  The faculty, the students and their families have boosted our spirits and helped in so many ways.  The staff at BES has made Holmes feel so welcomed and Holmes sure knows his way around the high school as well!  Students and staff alike make Holmes feel like the star he is!  ""The pie challenge on October 17th is something we called 'Whipping Childhood Cancer' in order to raise awareness and send love to Amber and the Rhodes Family, as well as raise money for Make a Wish, one of Amber's favorite charities.    ""Amber's brother Garrett challenged us with this earlier this year and we of course accepted and paid it forward to 7 others, helping to raise money for the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation.  We were ready for more pies and excitement...Holmes was especially looking forward to it!""  To follow up, a group of BHS teachers have organized  ""Rent-a- Student"" to help raise money for Holmes Team to cover mounting medical bills. The registration page is located at bit.ly/rent-a-student-2014.  Holmes also has a facebook page that many in our county are already following that keeps people up to date on how things are going and of events planned.  www.facebook.com/groups/holmesteam    Honestly, we have been humbled by the love, and he Holmes Team motto is ""Love Heals.""

While the temperature outside continued to rise, so did all the excitement. With the extremely hot weather, we changed our schedule to include more indoor activities. This helped both the campers and counselors stay as cool as possible. Of course, we added additional swim periods and encouraged lots of water breaks to help everyone beat the heat.  On Tuesday we had a surprise visit from the Glee Club who performed two fabulous songs. The Willows really had fun singing a repeat after me song with them. Uncle Teek, from security, also joined us for a delicious lunch the same day.  This weeks theme was Under the Sea. The Tadpoles and Minnows painted and decorated Goldfish Sun Catchers. In Ceramics, the campers enjoyed painting their clay hands and feet. All your childrens projects will be sent home shortly.

I spent NYE on Granville St in Vancouver BC with two other fantastic photographers capturing the fun of the evening. We lined up side-by-side, many people thought we were with a newspaper or that we knew something really amazing was just about to take place and they asked what it was and wanted to watch too. I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over. I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol. I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.   Some of the photos might seem a bit strange with the movement/blur but I find them artistic and you can find some interesting pictures within a photo when you let yourself just look without expectations. You may also notice the odd clear face/s that paused in all the movement & excitement. All in all, everyone was having a fantastic time!!

It's been a couple of years since I last visited Yosemite, and after spending the last year based in Shanghai I was champing at the bit to get back out into one of my favourite locations on the West Coast of America.  I suppose the combination of excitement and jetlag were to blame for me getting very little sleep the night before (with the long drive to and from Lake Tahoe the day before not taking it's toll as I expected it to either).  After heading out the door of my hotel in Sunnyvale around 5am, I was entering the boundary of Yosemite around 9am, too late for sunrise but early enough to beat the main flock of tourists who would decend on the park in the hours which followed.  I was rather disappointed to learn that the Glacier Point road had been closed overnight due to recent snowfall, after it being opened for around a week before my visit.  My plan of shooting half dome and it's buddies with snow caps on from Glacier Point was scuppered, so instead I made the most of my time wandering around the meadows of the valley floor, enjoying the ever-awesome view from ""tunnel view"" and the majestic scenery surrounding Mirror Lake.  You can bet your bottom dollar that I'll be back to Yosemite as soon as I possibly can be to hopefully capture some snow caps from Glacier Point (and head up to Tenaya Lake) before the park fully embraces the summer months ahead."

The theme of the event was Definitely Dallas! due to Omnis dedication to make each of their hotels look authentic to its location. On Friday, the first full day of the excitement-packed weekend, meeting planners chose to visit Cowboys Stadium, Southfork Ranch with J.R. Ewing himself, the famous Larry Hagman, or Texas Motor Speedway. Later that evening, planners attended Dallas Double Take event put on by DCVB where planners were encouraged by Mayor Rawlings, Larry Hagman and DCVB President Phillip Jones to take a second look at Dallas and the incredible attractions the city has to offer. Saturday brought more activities to experience in the busy Dallas area. Meeting planners visited the Old American Golf course, beautiful Dallas Arboretum and the Sixth Floor Museum. Other planners opted for the Whats new in Dallas? tour where they saw the Perot Museum of Nature and Science, expected to open in 2013, and the new Margaret Hunt-Hill Bridge, designed by Spanish Architect Santiago Calatrava. That evening, planners dressed in their best and went to the Gala Dinner hosted by MSNBCs Contessa Brewer. Planners dined while special guest Tim Halperin from American Idol performed his gorgeous piano melodies. At the after party, planners enjoyed a performance by country king and SMU alum Jack Ingram. The weekends festivities concluded the following morning with a farewell Gospel Brunch to send them back to their hometowns. The Omni Hotel in the heart of Downtown Dallas did a wonderful job introducing the meeting planners to our Dallas. Congratulations to the Omni Dallas Hotel on such a successful Grand Opening weekend. We hope when the meeting planners begin to plan their next meeting, they think Definitely Dallas! "

Fly Fishing Salmon River Report Im finding less fish around then the last few weeks. But, we are really just getting back to where the numbers are making more sense and where they normally should be at. There are 2 reasons why Im finding less fish. 1. These fish have a very difficult time getting out of peoples freezers and making there way back into the river. 2. Natural fish movement. - Today it was hard NOT to find them. We witnessed some incredible fights today and a few left us wanting. We used the drift boat and John was 5 for 12. Found them in 4 out of 6 spots. 3 from the first spot. Nothing from the next 2 spots. 3 from the 4th. 3 from the 5th. 3 more from the 6th spot. We left fish to find fish and probably could have played with more but the day had to end sometime. - John has been having a problem landing fish over the last few years. So today he was hopeful to actually see what they look like up close and personal. He also was interested in learning some new and exciting water that he could come back too on his own and fish. We succeeded on all fronts. Just about every spot was hold'n. I noticed other anglers and other guides clients also having pretty good luck today. Top to bottom of river. - (Photo's)  The Santa hat magically appeared out of my bag, just in time for the first fish picture. This next Steelhead we had to give chase in the boat and barely landed it. Directly below us was a fallen tree and shallow white water rapids. I set the anchor in the middle of the river, jumped out of the boat, gave chase and netted the fish just before it ran into the brush pile. John gave out a howler of satisfaction and excitement. - (Photo's)  Caught John in the middle of doing battle.         This picture shows who won! - (Photo's) What a honk'a! Approx. 16 lb'r. Great way to end the day! Congrats!! (All fish released) - I'd like to take a minute and THANK all of you,  who are putting some of your catch back. If it were not for some of you, I believe sincerely, that we could not have had such a productive day. Thanks again! Randy"

Never was that more true than during this performance by Arielle.  My set of still photos are a bit repetitive from image to image, given the style of this dance, and do not convey the full energy, excitement and virtuosity of the performer.  Fortunately there is a video of this performance, though I wish its quality were better.  Here's a youtube link allowing you to appreciate fully the artistry of this fantastic dancer.  Arielle does not profess to be a Tahitian dance or hula expert, but she makes up for it with her abundant enthusiasm. :-) Photo by Bill Tricomi Video at www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdHn7kgyh-0"

I had a good start but crashed after the first corner and well.... couldn't do much after that to catch up. I had lots of fun though! I love riding! I wore my GoPro on the chest mount and set it to take pictures every 2 seconds. Unfortunately when I crashed it got tilted down and it ended up taking picture of my legs instead of the track. It did make for some kind of cool shots though.
