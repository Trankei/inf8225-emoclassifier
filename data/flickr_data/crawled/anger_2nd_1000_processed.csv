She came to show her support to the country struggle to get over the financial crisis and the need to keep Greece inside the euro zone. Unfortunately, Greeks didnt felt nice about her visit, once she is remind them of the Germans occupation back in 1941 during the second World War. A lot of workers unions and independent groups of workers from retired people to firefighters and teachers have taken the streets to express their anger about the austerity measures that Greek government imposed to Greeks Greeks holds her personally responsible for the state of their economy for the last three years because of the lack of proper measures against recession.

Speeches from the platform and the conference floor highlighted the great potential of the 30 November strikes  with around 3 million members of 29 unions already set to take action.  They conveyed the groundspring of anger against the Tories, not just over pensions but over cuts, job losses and other attacks as well.  Serious But there was also a very serious and measured discussion about what activists need to do to make sure the strike is successful  both in workplaces on the ground and at a national level  and an understanding of some of the challenges of the situation.  The walls of the huge conference hall were lined with trade union banners and the atmosphere was one of serious debate by activists rooted in the labour movement and the working class.  Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the PCS civil service union, drew applause when he said 30 November was the beginning, not the end of the fight and that his union was already pushing for further joint strikes in the new year.  He also noted that although the PCS and teaching unions had staged a successful strike on 30 June, it had taken a long time and been hard to get the TUC to act. It had taken three years of arguments to get the TUC to call the 500,000 strong demo against austerity last March, he noted.  The PCS wanted a TUC meeting a fortnight after N30 to discuss further action he said.  New year Kevin Courtney, deputy secretary of the NUT teachers union also said his executive would push for more action in the new year if the government did not make sufficient concessions after N30.  He pointed out that teachers had paid 46bn more into their pension scheme than had been taken out  the argument that there is no money to pay for pensions is ridiculous.  Kevin also warned that because of the number of unions involved, there was a danger that activists might think the work of actually organising the strike day would be done by someone else and urged everyone to take responsibility for making the day a success.  His point was taken up from the floor by NUT rep Jess, who said she and local activists had realised the importance of putting the same level of organisation into N30 as they had into winning their original strike ballot more than six months ago  they could not assume that things would fall into place.  Community nurse Ann explained the real challenges of organising across small workplaces in the NHS  where there has not been much industrial action for decades and she was the only member of her branch to have been on strike before.  Remove In a stirring speech, John McDonnell MP argued that it was important to link the enthusiasm and energy of the protests by the Occupy movement and UK Uncut with the real strength of the unions.  He emphasised the seriousness of the struggle against austerity, and warned that it was time to remove union leaders who betrayed the movement.  The convention also heard well received contributions from Unison NEC member Paul Holmes, Unite NEC member and Southampton council strike leader Mark Wood, Birmingham Unison assistant branch secretary Caroline Johnson and Zita Holbourne of Black Activists Rising Against Cuts, among many others.  Ian Bradley and Steve Kelly, speaking about the sparks dispute that has rattled the big construction firms, argued for solidarity between public and private sector workers  it was the same battle, they emphasised.  Inspiring And there were standing ovations for the inspiring speech by Occupy Wall Street activist Leia Petty and a representative of the Greek power workers union who explained how members had refused to cut off the electricity of people who couldnt afford to pay their bills.  The convention sent a message of solidarity to those protesting in Tahrir Square, after hearing a powerful message of support for the N30 strike from hospital workers union leader Mohammed Shafiq who had been prevented from attending because the British Embassy in Cairo refused his visa application.  There were useful and inspiring contributions from many other speakers from the platform and the floor, with a particularly lively discussion at the packed workshop on resisting austerity in our communities.  We would like to thank all 1,188 people who attended  many after travelling long distances  and all the speakers, session chairs and members of the conference arrangements committee who helped to make the event a great success.  Now the task for activists is to put into practice the lessons from the day and build the biggest and most active strike possible on 30 November  lets show our strength! "

The march was organised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions but included many with no union affiliations looking for an outlet to vent their anger at the present government.   The route went from Wood Quay to the GPO in O'Connell Street where a series of speeches were held. The atmosphere along the route was peaceful and family-friendly. After the main speeches, Joe Higgins MEP and Richard Boyd-Barrett from a new grouping called the United Left Alliance, addressed the crowds from underneath the O'Connell monument.   Following the main march, a small group of protesters marched to the Dail (Irish Parliament) where they set fire to a poster of Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Brian Cowen. A heavy Garda (Irish Police) presence ensured that this later demonstration passed off without major incident. "

An agreement had been worked out and things had been going quite nicely, said Molokai resident Walter Ritte, but this show of force has put everything in a tail spin, he said of the increased enforcement presence.  Ritte was among the group that shared words of discontent today, calling the government response unfortunate.  A variety of signs held in the demonstration included the statements, Were not terrorists, Be pono to Molokai, and, We have the right to access our ocean ways.  The vessel, owned by the American Safari Cruises company, temporarily suspended port calls to the island last month in response to community concerns and a water blockade; but service resumed today under a compromise agreement reached with protesters who have argued that there was a lack of a community process in decisions related to tourism and its affects on the islands lifestyle and resources.   Safari Explorer protest. Courtesy photo 1/21/12. Supporters of the operation maintain that the 36-passenger Safari Explorer yacht supports local business, and helps to address the islands historically high unemployment rate.  Company officials said the vessel resumed its visits to Molokai in accordance with the agreement reached with all parties.  Unfortunately, a group of people chose not to abide by the agreement for a peaceful resumption of visits to the island, but many signs were also observed welcoming the yachts guests to Molokai, said Sarah Scoltock, Director of Communications & Business Development at American Safari Cruises.  As the vessel returned, the state announced plans to implement a security zone one hour prior to the vessels harbor entries and departures.  Demonstrators expressed anger and resentment over additional enforcement presence saying it, brought out many more protesters, and made things worse.  Officials with the Maui Police Department said there were no reports of disorderly conduct and no arrests were made upon the ships arrival.  Company officials said the yacht docked without obstruction, and guests toured the island as planned during the day.  An evening paina was also held celebrating one of the guests 70th birthday.  Ritte said, The Aha Kiole o Molokai is still determined to keep its word, and will stand by its agreement to work with its community and present documents of its findings to the government after its meetings with the Molokai community.  He further stated that, The goal of the Aha Kiole is to bring a voice to its grass roots community that is fair and representative.  Reprinted from January 21, 2012 MauiNOW.com"

Thousands of university, college and school students  joined by workers  are marching in London and Manchester against Tory cuts to education, fee rises and attacks on jobs and services.  The revolution in Tunisia and uprising in Egypt have clearly inspired the marches. Marchers have chanted, Egypt, Egypt everywhere.  London  Aisha, an FE student from Camden in north London said, Ive been on all the demonstrations, but some of my friends are here who havent been out on the protests before.   I like the slogan This is only the beginning, because its going to be a long fight against this government.  Theo, a school student from south east London, took part in the Day X walkouts last year. He said, Lots of people who want to go to university wont be able to and people will definitely be affected by the cuts to EMA [Education Maintenance Allowance]. The government is making the wrong people pay  the bankers are getting hundreds of thousands in bonuses. For workers, the student protests have been an inspiration.  A GMB rep joining the protest in London said, Im here to show solidarity with the students. Ive got a daughter who has just gone through university and there is no way she would have been able to afford 9,000 a year fees.  Im also here to say that I dont believe in these cuts. Weve got to stick together workers and students. I think that the TUC demo on the 26 March can give people confidence to fight.  UCU lecturer Vicky Margree works at the University of Brighton. She said, We face 100 percent cut in arts and humanities funding which will hit universities hard. And the new fees will make university unaffordable for the majority of people.  Kelly Rogers, a Unison organiser, said, Unless we show solidarity with younger people we may as well give up. Students have led the way and enthused workers, showing us how to fight.  Solidarity with the Egyptian uprising  In London the mood was electric as up to a thousand students joined the many hundreds of people already protesting in solidarity with the Egyptian people outside the embassy off Park Lane.  Chants of Solidarity, solidarity, London and Cairo unite and fight and Hey ho Mubarak has to go are ringing through the air.  One man on the original protest said, I cant believe that all these young people have come to support us. This makes us feel even stronger. I cant wait to send the pictures of all you British people who have come to support us to people back home.  Before reaching the embassy, the protest stopped outside the Tory HQ at Millbank  a focus of student anger and protests last year  as students chanted, Tory scum, here we come.

His grasp on my arm tightened even more when my finger reached for the trigger. Both Jax and Knack where saying something as they had me pinned to the wall. I didnt really care, the adrenaline had taken over and all I wanted to do was get at Stim. And nothing they could say could stop me. So I made a surge with everything I had to vanquish their affirmed hold on me. Even with a lot of adrenaline to add, it wasnt quite enough to overcome the two men, identical to myself in every gene. But I had always been clever when it came to problem solving, even if my solutions werent the prettiest. I delivered a violent knee to the armor-less Knacks stomach without any delay. He let out a grunt, as he fell to the ground, but my attention quickly turned to Jax as my struggle with him began. Attempting to stop my advancements Jax quickly put me in a chokehold that went noticed but my windpipe, as well as my lungs.  To free the lock I had no choice but to flip my him over top of me and onto the cold floor with an extreme amount of force. His back hit first which forced all the breath from him in a short and hard burst.   One brother was face up, one face down, the other laying in blood finally coming. I walked over to him and my anger began to cool. His eyes opened and to his surprise he saw me standing there, his eyes dilated and he froze like something from Hoth. Mal then walked in. The irritating noise his shoes made gave him away.  Im sorry Stim. I said, not the reaction he expected. But you dont bring up things like that, am I clear.   I promise and I . . . Im, sorry also. That was something that probably never came out of Stims big mouth.  I then gave him my hand and aided him to his feet away from the small pool of blood he had been lying in.  It was a bigger pool of blood then I had hoped for. I did wonder if he knew I kept my vibroblade handy at all times, or that I had followed through accidentally cutting a chunk from his face. Which made a noticeable scar from his cheekbone down to his top lip. I guess it was a good reminder, just in case he wanted to ever open that big mouth of his about me, ever again.   Getting things out of the way I see? Good. Mal said.  He then walked over to take Stim from me and he guided him to the restroom. I then made my approach over to Jax and Knack who were getting up at a gradual pace. I aided Knack to his bed, then Jax.  Im sorry boys, but you shouldve known better. I truly didnt want to hurt them, after all they were my brothers. And instantly guilt flowed over me for what Id done to them especially to Stim But the two of them just both looked at me and smiled.  Its all good sarge. Jax said with a smile on his face. You couldnt of just asked us to let go of you?! Knack said in a vibrant tone. He was always the funny one and he knew how to lighten the mood at just the right times. We all laughed at that. A short while later Stim and Mal entered. Stim was applying some bacta to his face, he even managed a small smile, followed by a laugh. Mal then handed out our food and carried on where he had left off, regarding the mission outlines, like nothing had ever even happened . . .  It seemed my whole life the odds had been against me. Whether it was being placed with three other clones with obvious issues to compliment my own, or that almost everyone didnt think we would succeed as clone commandos, or even on the Zero hour.

They left the box in the yard, and my dad's guys took the chair out of the box and brought it in.  My mom plugged it in, pressed the lift, et voila!  Something called the recline screw drive is simply cracked.  Just cracked in half.    I called the company who sold me the chair, and they are calling the manufacturer, who would be calling me right backa couple of hours ago.  I have a feeling I am going to be screwed yet again.  This is what happens to a fighter who has been knocked down too many times.  It is very hard to take control of my life back when I can't even make lunch.  Do you understand that?  I can do so little that I can't even SOUND powerful on the phone anymore.  My anger sounds angry, and not righteous.  But mostly I have a pitiful littleness to me that I wouldn't tolerate from anyone.  I knitted this hat.  I am such a good knitter that these tight little stitches came out perfectly.  It's not the most flattering hat, but it's cute enough.  If I weren't haggy, I could make it work, I guess.  UGH.  In other news, I feel very much better todaya combination of being up and about yesterday (tired though it made me) and sleeping in the chair.  I actually went a longer time between pills.  But I felt so good that when I sneezed, I forgot how miserable it would feel.  And yeah, I cried my eyes out for a good few minutes afterward.   "

Carrying placards which portrayed President Basescu as a mafioso, and the country's un-reconstructed communist-era security service as resembling the SS, the protesters said they felt like ""second-hand Europeans"", accusing their government of widespread corruption and arrogance.  The second poorest country in the European Union with a per capita income less than half the EU average - and struggling to cope with the continuing shockwaves of the Europe-wide recession - Romanians have recently seen swingeing cuts made to public health and welfare programs, wages slashed by 25% and sales tax increased by Basescu's close political ally, Prime Minister Emil Boc, triggering a wave of mass demonstrations in this usually subdued country over the past week, with the threat of general strikes called by trade unions and workers laid off by the defence sector, who want Basescu to resign.  Last Thursday - 19.01.2012 - saw over 7,000 leftist opposition USL alliance and anti-austerity protesters clashing with police in Bucharest who fired tear gas against demonstrators, some of whom threw bricks and rubbish bins in retaliation, and on Saturday, several hundred people assembled for a ninth successive day in Bucharest's University Square, known as 'Kilometre Zero of Democracy' for its role in the 1989 anti-communist revolution. There were also protests in  Cluj, Timisoara, Brasov and Arad.  All photos  2012 Pete Riches Do not reproduce, alter or reblog my images without my written permission.

This was for my first project as a second year graphic design student. The brief stated that we must create a book based on the author Edgar Allan Poe's short stories. The story I selected was called 'The Tell-Tale Heart'. This story was about a crazy man who kills an old man because he didn't like his eye. With my book I decided to tackle to the brief using a comic/ graphic novel approach. This meant using speech bubbles and panels. This also influenced my illustration style to be bold and vibrant. This illustration is meant to represent the crazy mans victory in killing the old man thus destroying the eye. In the brief we were only allowed to use 3 colours, so I chose red, white and black. In this particular image, I chose to use red and the background colour to not only represent blood but to represent anger, rage and adrenaline. I chose to to colour the eye in red to represent what the man perceived as evil."

The massacre in Iraq sparked a Nov. 8 protest in downtown Phoenix.  Wearing black, carrying posters and waving Assyrian and American flags, about 600 protesters converged on Cesar Chavez Plaza. Many were from Iraq and belong to Assyrian, Chaldean and other Eastern Catholic churches across the Valley.   Chanting We want peace, and boosting signs that read America wake up! they held photos of some of the victims lying in pools of blood, and listened as Steve Darmo, an ASU student, addressed the crowd through a loudspeaker.  They died for love and peace ... they didnt pray for Christians or Muslims or Jews. They were praying for humans. Were not here to let their blood go to waste, Darmo said. Were not going to let this genocide go on.  Mona Oshana, carrying the red Lectionary used at her Assyrian church in Phoenix, expressed her anger and frustration over the murders as sweat poured off her brow in the noon-day sun.  How long will the body of Christ stay silent? Oshana fumed. This is not just about the Christians of Iraq. This is about the body of Christ thats being decimated in the roots of where Christianity came from. Where is the outrage of the body of Christ?  Ban Salman, an Iraqi woman standing beside her, carried a framed picture of her cousin who was killed in the massacre.  Oshana choked back tears as she retold how nine terrorists, wearing explosive-packed vests, stormed the cathedral.  A woman trying to save her child from the bullets covered her child with her body, Oshana said. They flipped her over and purposely killed the child and allowed the child to die in front of the mother while she was holding onto his neck because he was bleeding.  Iraq, a country of 31 million, is home to just 500,000 Christians. The terrorists who invaded the church claimed to be members of an Al-Qaeda cell and held 120 churchgoers hostage during the ordeal. One attacker blew himself up; the others were killed when Iraqi security forces entered the building.  Msgr. Felix Shabi, episcopal vicar for the Chaldean Catholic Church in Arizona and a native of Iraq, was not able to attend the Nov. 7 protest, but relayed some of the details of the attack in a phone interview with The Catholic Sun.  When [the terrorists] came to the church, the priest had just finished reading the Gospel, Msgr. Shabi said. He told them, Please, we are praying, just leave us in peace.  The terrorists demanded the priest make an Islamic announcement. When he refused, he was shot. They then demanded that a 4-month-old baby who was crying shut up. A second priest told the terrorists the mother was trying to calm the infant.  The gunmans response was to shoot the priest, then turn his gun on the baby.  We need your prayers and support, Msgr. Shabi said. Our hands, our hearts, our brains, are all mingled with the blood of martyrs.  Mike Darmo, spokesman for the American Assyrian Youth Coalition, which was formed in the days after the attack on the church, said about 20 Muslim leaders were at the protest too.  People are dying for no reason. Terrorism is hateful and we must stop it, Darmo said. What were here to do is make the world aware and join in a coalition of every religion to stop terrorism.  Similar protests were held in other U.S. cities Nov. 7 as well. Pope Benedict XVI condemned the attack, calling it savage.  I pray for the victims of this absurd violence, the pontiff said in a Nov. 1 address, even more ferocious in that it has been inflicted upon defenseless people gathered in Gods house, which is a house of love and reconciliation.
