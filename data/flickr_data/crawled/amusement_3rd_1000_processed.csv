In 1946 when Mr Goddard died, the Pearson Publishing Company took over the zoo and managed it until 1978, when the Tussaud Group took control of the park (Tussauds was a subsidiary of the Pearson Group). In 1984, due to the zoo's declining attendance, Tussaudss Director of Development, Ray Barratt commissioned John Wardley to come up with plans to revitalise the park, and the decision was made to open an amusement park to complement the zoo, and so Chessington World of Adventures was born. The park opened with a new monorail, a powered coaster, log flume and a dark ride (all supplied by the German ride manufacturer Heinrich Mack GmbH & Co). The new rides were to operate on a pay-one-price admission basis, and replace the existing pay-as-you-go fairground rides. The monorail, named the Safari Skyway, opened early in 1986 to give the visitors a foretaste of the new attraction. ""Chessington World of Adventures"" opened as a theme park in 1987. The attractions were all heavily themed with emphasis on atmosphere and effects, meaning Chessington was one of the first true theme parks in Britain. On 22 May 2007, The Tussauds Group was taken over by Merlin Entertainments Ltd, which owns other brands, including the Sealife Centre, and The Dungeons. This meant that Alton Towers, Thorpe Park and Madame Tussauds were also taken over as well. As a result of this purchase Merlin became the second largest entertainments operator in the world, ahead of Parques Reunidos and second only to Disney. The park has a large selection of attractions. It also has over 1,000 animals, many of which can be seen from the Safari Skyway, an elevated monorail around the Zoo. Chessington has been in the same ownership as nearby Thorpe Park since 1998, and since 2007, Legoland Windsor.[1] Since Chessington World of Adventures and Thorpe Park are located within 20 miles of each other, its owner Merlin has made efforts to market the two parks to different age groups: Chessington World of Adventures is meant to appeal to children while Thorpe Park strives to thrill older thrillseekers.

Along with many other small operations on Ocean Beach, Arthur Looff operated ""Looff's Hippodrome,"" a merry-go-round, and John Friedle operated a shooting gallery and ""Babyland"" (knock down the babies with a baseball).  From 1914 on they suffered the ups and downs previous small operators endured.  Friedle bought the Hippodrome and by 1921 had spent $150,000 on ten new rides and the name became ""The Chutes at the Beach.""  Wild boat rides, roller coasters, the Aeroplane Swing, Ferris Wheel, and a large midway with hundreds of games and attractions entertained the public. In 1928, George K. whitney became manager of the park and around 1942 bought out the Friedles.  During the late 1940s and 50s, Playland was rebuilt and expanded.  Whitney died in 1971 and Playland was sold to Jeremy Ets-Hokin and eventually demolished and replaced by housing projects."

Bezirk, Wiener Prater (Wurstelprater), pleasure grounds (parque de atracciones, luna park, fte foraine) (for further pictures or information please go to the end of page and by clicking on the link you will get them as soon as possible!) The Vienna Prater Lieblingsnahausflugsziel (favourite nearby excursion destination) in Biedermeier Vienna is the Prater. The season opens with the race of ""noble runners"" on May 1. The usually before the carriages of the nobility running lackeys on that day line up under high bets to public competition. The main avenue along to the pleasure house (Lusthaus) and back drag the racers to the cheers of the audience. Trumpet-blasts, flags and cash prizes await the winner. Military music they escorts into the first Prater coffee house where them a splendid breakfast is arranged, while the ones having fallen by the wayside are collected. This race is banned in 1848 because of inhumanity. In the afternoon swayed - as from now on every Sunday - people and cars down the hunter line (Jgerzeile - since 1862 Prater Road). The state-carriages of the Court, the nobility and the wealthy bourgeoisie to evening make in a continuous parade the main street with its lofty Prater coffee houses to a ""Nobel Prater"". ""Bey the public-houses (Inns)"" in the Prater. Coloured engraving, T. Mollo. 1825 The people has fun in the Wurstelprater (Hanswurst, clowning on Vienna stages) in a tangle of guest houses and Prater lodges, puppet booths, calendula games and swings between the Prater harpists, salami sellers and spectacle. Here is the stronghold of the showmen with their monkey theater and flea circus, jugglers and fire-eaters, giants and dwarfs, menageries, panoramas, wax figures and ghostly apparitions. On the ""Zirkuswiese"" in Circus gymnasticus the popular equestrian companies by Christoph de Bach (? 1808) and Alexander Guerra perform. One camps in the Prater floodplains and waits until at nightfall on the ""fireworks meadow"" Stuwer (? 1802) lets shoot up his sparkling rockets. City Chronicle Vienna Dr. Christian Brandsttter, Dr. Gnter Treffer 2000 years in data, documents and images From the beginnings to the present Courtesy Christian Brandsttter Verlag mbH The publishing service for museums, businesses and public authorities www.brandstaetter - verlag.at The historically grown amusement park looks back to a rich history. First documentary references of that area, which originally had jungle-like character, go back to the 12th Century. The former imperial hunting ground in 1766 under the ""popular"" Austrian Emperor Joseph II was made accessible to the public. Soon after, a number of small entertainment venues (carousels, shooting  galleries, food stalls, ...) arrived, entertaining the people and also providing for the physical well-being. The inhabitants of Vienna enjoyed themselves by riding artfully designed Hutschpferden (swing horses) and by swinging into lofty altitudes. In the process you could with long poles jab into rings. Hence the name carousel. It had been created recreational devices for the general public. The fireworks of Stuwer and the balloon ascents end of the 18th Century dragged the Viennese from the city to the fairgrounds in the Prater. Following the trend of the times were national artistic institutions (theaters, waxworks museum and people museum - ""Pruschers panopticon"" with 2,000 objects, Vivarium, Planetarium, ... ) built and connected to the hustle and bustle. Sensations in the old Prater were the Abnormittenshows (abnormalities) in which Lilliputian, Hirsute men, Siamese twins including ""Freaks"" (monster, abnormal shape) were to see. The thick Prater-Mitzi or the Russian-born trunk man Kobelkoff, as well as the ghostly magic theater of Kratky Baschik enriched the morphology of the bizarre Prater landscape. With the development of technology and electricity, the entertainment in the Prater was becoming more and more diverse. In the emerging age of railways, the in Trieste born Basilio Calafati founded the first railway carousel in 1844. In this hut in 1854 the figure of the ""big Chinesers"" was set up as a mast. Many showmen and technicians from all over the Austrian-Hungarian monarchy, but also from the rest of Europe in the illustrious Viennese amusement park their ideas put into practice. The Englishman Basset succeeded in 1897 to set up the still existing Ferris wheel in the Prater. This vehicle with a diameter of 61 meters originally had 30 cars. When the first ""living pictures"", the Cinematography, were born, 1896 the first cinema was opened in the Prater. Electricity in 1898 the first electrically operated Grottenbahn brought in the Prater. This fairytale train was also the first in Europe. On the occasion of the popularity of the airplane in 1911 the first ""Aeroplan Carousel"" was established. Followed in 1926 the first ""Autodrome"" and in 1933 the first ""ghost train"". In 1928, the still running ""Liliputbahn"", a reduced form of the great steam locomotives was placed in the Prater. 1935 brought a Prater entrepreneur from Chicago the rapid ""flight path"" in the Prater, a system not running on rails. The Prater always changed its face, modernized and adapted itself to the trend of times. One attraction always replaced the other. Only few historical venues have been able to transport themselves into the present. Tradition-conscious companies such as the ""Pony Carousel"" from the year 1887 or the nostalgic slide tower ""switchback (Tobogan)"" from the 50s fight against the taste of the times and the needs of the visitors. In popularity but the historic Ferris wheel, the ""Miniature Train"" and of course the restaurant ""Swiss House"" (specialty: stilt and beer) will never lose. Rickety ghost trains and sparkling grotto railways, although dusty, will not allow to be pushed out of the Prater. Between the historical venues flash the new, modern, hydraulically operated high-tech fairground rides. 1909-1944 the enormous dimensioned ""roller coaster"" always was a magnet for the Prater trippers. A reduced form is the after the war built ""Neue Wiener roller coaster"". Was swallowed entirely by history the magnificent ""Venice in Vienna"". On the site of the present Emperor's Meadow (Kaiserwiese) was located around the turn of the century the illusory world of the artificially recreated lagoon city. The initiator Gabor Steiner created in 1895 a world in the Prater, in which not only the high society, but also the Bohemian maids and the soldiers of the Austro-Hungarian multinational state amused themselves. In the era of the fin de sicle (= the decadent over-refinement of feeling and taste at the end of the 19th century), in which the Prater flourished, performed the most famous conductors of the time (Strauss, Lanner, Ziehrer). Characteristic for the Wiener Prater today is also the adjacent green, left in its naturale state Praterau (Prater floodplain). An engaging recreational landscape with trees, meadows and ponds. Through this welcoming and quiet part of the Prater leads the 4.5 km long main avenue, which is lined with old chestnut trees. At the time, colorful flower parades were held there where, inter alia, even the Emperor and Empress and Mayor Lueger showed up. Along the main avenue were situated the now defunct, three famous coffee houses. The1783 built by Canevale ""pleasure house"" (Lusthaus) at the end of the main avenue, however, is still to be found. Past is the ""Vaudeville Light"", where for a long time popular movie stars and artists of yesteryear (Aslan, Jeritza, Moser, ... ) entertained the Prater audience. To the Prater belongs also the fairgrounds. There in 1873 took place the world exhibition. The Rotunda, those proud crowned by a cupola central building in 1937 became a prey to the flames. What in the course of time of historic buildings of facilities in the Prater not had outlived itself, was destroyed in World War II. The most severely battered amusement park but was rebuilt. It established itself again as an integral part of the cultural entertainment of the city of Vienna. The force measuring machine ""Watschenmann"" is part of the local history of this unique institution, but also the cheeky and defiant ""Prater Puppet"" characterizes the color of the Vienna Prater. www.wien-vienna.at/index.php?ID=705"

Shuishang Gongyuan (), or Tianjin Water Park, is easily my favorite city park in Tianjin and  to date  in China.  Granted, I havent been to nearly enough places in China to make a more comprehensive statement, but of the parks Ive been to in Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, this is easily my favorite.  Its the largest urban park in the city at a little over 300 acres of space.  The park was officially opened in its current state by the communist government in 1951.  Previously, it had been known as Green Dragon Pond and has a history that dates back to the first century AD.  With the establishment of Beiyang University and Nankai University at the turn of the 20th century, the waterways of the park became popular for swimming among academic staff and students during the hot summer months.  (Summation via Wikipedia entry.)  The park is quite pleasant year-round.  In summer, the lotus pond is bursting with flowers and the photographers who love to shoot them.  In spring and fall, various flowers bloom (chrysanthemums in fall, peonies in spring).  Winter brings a freezing of the lakes  and there are three:  East Lake, West Lake, and South Lake  whereas summer brings a rash of personal boaters.  In addition to leisurely strolling around the grounds with the various pavilions, verandas, and pagodas, the Tianjin Zoo (separate admission) is also on the grounds of the park.  Also, there is an amusement park in the northeast corner of the park.  Amusement parks are pretty common fare among Chinas city parks, which make them slightly different than American city parks.  Shuishang Gongyuan is quite easy to locate.  It is nearest the Tianta subway station on line 3 of the Tianjin Metro, about a 5-10 minute walk from any of the exits (though exits C & D are technically the closest).  The Tianta TV Tower (whence comes the name of the subway station) is also nearby and quite prominently visible from many places in the park.  Ive yet to venture to the top of the tower, but it would provide an excellent viewing platform for a panoramic view of the park, weather permitting. "

The Tiger Balm Gardens, nowadays known as Haw Par Villa, are one of Singapore's most unique and iconic sites, a Chinese mythological sculpture park filled with colourful tableaux of vivid, often truly bizarre imagery.   It was begun in 1937 by the two Aw brothers (Boon Haw - Gentle Tiger, and Boon Par - gentle Leopard) who had found fortune marketing their father's popular invention, Tiger Balm, hence the original name of the park. Their intention was to create an educational theme park dedicated to Chinese culture, bringing to life various scenes from Chinese myth and legend, along with Buddhist themes such as virtue and vice, reincarnation and hell. It was intended for free public access, for families to learn from and enjoy.  The park was taken over by the local authorities in 1979 and sadly it's revamp in the 1980s was not a happy one, as it was decided to make it into a paying visitor attraction through transformation into the 'Dragon World' amusement park, which entailed some of the original tableaux and sculptures being removed to make way for rides, and hefty entrance fees introduced, never part of the founders' vision.   Over the years visitor numbers decreased sharply and the amusement park elements were eventually dismantled, leaving the sculptures as the main attraction once more and the park is again free to enter, though sadly short of visitors compared to the height of it's popularity when whole crowds thronged the place in the 1960s. Part of the problem lies in it's distance from the centre of Singapore, though with the new Haw Par Villa MRT station opening next door in 2011 getting there now couldn't be easier.  The Tiger Balm Garden was somewhere I'd longed to see since childhood, having heard my parents descriptions with their photos of this fascinating, surrealist landscape of exotic sculpture (their last address in Singapore was a flat not far away on Pasir Panjang Road). It is a great pity a few of the pieces they photographed have since vanished, but the bulk remains as it was, and to finally be visiting it myself was an amazing experience, there was simply no question of us leaving Singapore until we'd done it!  www.kuriositas.com/2011/01/haw-par-villa-unusual-singapor..."

The Sydney Royal Easter Show,  also known as the Royal Easter Show or simply The Show, is an annual show held in Sydney, Australia over two weeks around Easter. It is run by the Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales and was first held in 1823. Queen Victoria, (18371901), awarded the society and its show the right to use the word ""Royal"" in its name.   The Show is historically an event where ""city meets country"" and the rural industries of Australia can be shown and celebrated once a year.  The Show comprises an agricultural show, an amusement park and a fair and combines the elements of each, showcasing the judging of livestock and produce. This comprehensive fair has many competitions including arts and crafts, photography and cookery, as well as tests of strength and skill such as wood chopping.  The Show also has shopping, restaurants, commercial stands and exhibits, a horticultural display, a national accredited conformation dog show and cat show, and stage and arena shows.  The Show currently attracts over one million people per year.  The Sydney Royal Easter Show is the largest event held in Australia, and the sixth largest in the world.   Wikipedia"

The Vienna Prater Lieblingsnahausflugsziel (favourite nearby excursion destination) in Biedermeier Vienna is the Prater. The season opens with the race of ""noble runners"" on May 1. The usually before the carriages of the nobility running lackeys on that day line up under high bets to public competition. The main avenue along to the pleasure house (Lusthaus) and back drag the racers to the cheers of the audience. Trumpet-blasts, flags and cash prizes await the winner. Military music they escorts into the first Prater coffee house where them a splendid breakfast is arranged, while the ones having fallen by the wayside are collected. This race is banned in 1848 because of inhumanity. In the afternoon swayed - as from now on every Sunday - people and cars down the hunter line (Jgerzeile - since 1862 Prater Road). The state-carriages of the Court, the nobility and the wealthy bourgeoisie to evening make in a continuous parade the main street with its lofty Prater coffee houses to a ""Nobel Prater"". ""Bey the public-houses (Inns)"" in the Prater. Coloured engraving, T. Mollo. 1825 The people has fun in the Wurstelprater (Hanswurst, clowning on Vienna stages) in a tangle of guest houses and Prater lodges, puppet booths, calendula games and swings between the Prater harpists, salami sellers and spectacle. Here is the stronghold of the showmen with their monkey theater and flea circus, jugglers and fire-eaters, giants and dwarfs, menageries, panoramas, wax figures and ghostly apparitions. On the ""Zirkuswiese"" in Circus gymnasticus the popular equestrian companies by Christoph de Bach (? 1808) and Alexander Guerra perform. One camps in the Prater floodplains and waits until at nightfall on the ""fireworks meadow"" Stuwer (? 1802) lets shoot up his sparkling rockets. City Chronicle Vienna Dr. Christian Brandsttter, Dr. Gnter Treffer 2000 years in data, documents and images From the beginnings to the present Courtesy Christian Brandsttter Verlag mbH The publishing service for museums, businesses and public authorities www.brandstaetter - verlag.at The historically grown amusement park looks back to a rich history. First documentary references of that area, which originally had jungle-like character, go back to the 12th Century. The former imperial hunting ground in 1766 under the ""popular"" Austrian Emperor Joseph II was made accessible to the public. Soon after, a number of small entertainment venues (carousels, shooting galleries, food stalls, ...) arrived, entertaining the people and also providing for the physical well-being. The inhabitants of Vienna enjoyed themselves by riding artfully designed Hutschpferden (swing horses) and by swinging into lofty altitudes. In the process you could with long poles jab into rings. Hence the name carousel. It had been created recreational devices for the general public. The fireworks of Stuwer and the balloon ascents end of the 18th Century dragged the Viennese from the city to the fairgrounds in the Prater. Following the trend of the times were national artistic institutions (theaters, waxworks museum and people museum - ""Pruschers panopticon"" with 2,000 objects, Vivarium, Planetarium, ... ) built and connected to the hustle and bustle. Sensations in the old Prater were the Abnormittenshows (abnormalities) in which Lilliputian, Hirsute men, Siamese twins including ""Freaks"" (monster, abnormal shape) were to see. The thick Prater-Mitzi or the Russian-born trunk man Kobelkoff, as well as the ghostly magic theater of Kratky Baschik enriched the morphology of the bizarre Prater landscape. With the development of technology and electricity, the entertainment in the Prater was becoming more and more diverse. In the emerging age of railways, the in Trieste born Basilio Calafati founded the first railway carousel in 1844. In this hut in 1854 the figure of the ""big Chinesers"" was set up as a mast. Many showmen and technicians from all over the Austrian-Hungarian monarchy, but also from the rest of Europe in the illustrious Viennese amusement park their ideas put into practice. The Englishman Basset succeeded in 1897 to set up the still existing Ferris wheel in the Prater. This vehicle with a diameter of 61 meters originally had 30 cars. When the first ""living pictures"", the Cinematography, were born, 1896 the first cinema was opened in the Prater. Electricity in 1898 the first electrically operated Grottenbahn brought in the Prater. This fairytale train was also the first in Europe. On the occasion of the popularity of the airplane in 1911 the first ""Aeroplan Carousel"" was established. Followed in 1926 the first ""Autodrome"" and in 1933 the first ""ghost train"". In 1928, the still running ""Liliputbahn"", a reduced form of the great steam locomotives was placed in the Prater. 1935 brought a Prater entrepreneur from Chicago the rapid ""flight path"" in the Prater, a system not running on rails. The Prater always changed its face, modernized and adapted itself to the trend of times. One attraction always replaced the other. Only few historical venues have been able to transport themselves into the present. Tradition-conscious companies such as the ""Pony Carousel"" from the year 1887 or the nostalgic slide tower ""switchback (Tobogan)"" from the 50s fight against the taste of the times and the needs of the visitors. In popularity but the historic Ferris wheel, the ""Miniature Train"" and of course the restaurant ""Swiss House"" (specialty: stilt and beer) will never lose. Rickety ghost trains and sparkling grotto railways, although dusty, will not allow to be pushed out of the Prater. Between the historical venues flash the new, modern, hydraulically operated high-tech fairground rides. 1909-1944 the enormous dimensioned ""roller coaster"" always was a magnet for the Prater trippers. A reduced form is the after the war built ""Neue Wiener roller coaster"". Was swallowed entirely by history the magnificent ""Venice in Vienna"". On the site of the present Emperor's Meadow (Kaiserwiese) was located around the turn of the century the illusory world of the artificially recreated lagoon city. The initiator Gabor Steiner created in 1895 a world in the Prater, in which not only the high society, but also the Bohemian maids and the soldiers of the Austro-Hungarian multinational state amused themselves. In the era of the fin de sicle (= the decadent over-refinement of feeling and taste at the end of the 19th century), in which the Prater flourished, performed the most famous conductors of the time (Strauss, Lanner, Ziehrer). Characteristic for the Wiener Prater today is also the adjacent green, left in its naturale state Praterau (Prater floodplain). An engaging recreational landscape with trees, meadows and ponds. Through this welcoming and quiet part of the Prater leads the 4.5 km long main avenue, which is lined with old chestnut trees. At the time, colorful flower parades were held there where, inter alia, even the Emperor and Empress and Mayor Lueger showed up. Along the main avenue were situated the now defunct, three famous coffee houses. The1783 built by Canevale ""pleasure house"" (Lusthaus) at the end of the main avenue, however, is still to be found. Past is the ""Vaudeville Light"", where for a long time popular movie stars and artists of yesteryear (Aslan, Jeritza, Moser, ... ) entertained the Prater audience. To the Prater belongs also the fairgrounds. There in 1873 took place the world exhibition. The Rotunda, those proud crowned by a cupola central building in 1937 became a prey to the flames. What in the course of time of historic buildings of facilities in the Prater not had outlived itself, was destroyed in World War II. The most severely battered amusement park but was rebuilt. It established itself again as an integral part of the cultural entertainment of the city of Vienna. The force measuring machine ""Watschenmann"" is part of the local history of this unique institution, but also the cheeky and defiant ""Prater Puppet"" characterizes the color of the Vienna Prater. www.wien-vienna.at/index.php?ID=705"

The Sydney Royal Easter Show,  also known as the Royal Easter Show or simply The Show, is an annual show held in Sydney, Australia over two weeks around Easter. It is run by the Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales and was first held in 1823. Queen Victoria, (18371901), awarded the society and its show the right to use the word ""Royal"" in its name.   The Show is historically an event where ""city meets country"" and the rural industries of Australia can be shown and celebrated once a year.  The Show comprises an agricultural show, an amusement park and a fair and combines the elements of each, showcasing the judging of livestock and produce. This comprehensive fair has many competitions including arts and crafts, photography and cookery, as well as tests of strength and skill such as wood chopping.  The Show also has shopping, restaurants, commercial stands and exhibits, a horticultural display, a national accredited conformation dog show and cat show, and stage and arena shows.  The Show currently attracts over one million people per year.  The Sydney Royal Easter Show is the largest event held in Australia, and the sixth largest in the world.   Wikipedia"

Media event at Entertainment Quarter, Fox Studios, Moore Park, Sydney, Australia - 9th January 2013...   EMPIRE enjoyed its media bash and first Sydney showing at Entertainment Quarter, Moore Park, this evening, in front of a capacity crowd of 700.  Think Cirque du Soleil meets burlesque meets Rocky Horror Picture Show and your on the right track.  The show offers Sydney something different, when shows and promoters have to fight for the publics entertainment dollar more than ever.  Tickets from $69 up to $149.  If you like risque entertainment, this is well worth a look.  Be sure to check out our rather exclusive and rare photos to further tease you into buying a ticket this season.  Promo...  Direct from its world premiere hit season on Broadway, EMPIRE is the most jaw-dropping show ever seen on the intimate spiegeltent stage. Somersaulting, slapsticking and stripteasing... the most beautiful, daring and incredibly talented artists have been brought together from all over the globe.  Presented by Spiegelworld and Nine Live, EMPIRE is a love letter from New York City, inspired by the vintage days of vaudeville, the night clubs of the East Village, the eccentric characters on Times Square and the big apple's propensity to simply show off. Smashing through the borders of comedy, circus, variety and burlesque, EMPIRE is a weekend-long party in Manhattan, squeezed into 90 minutes and onto a 9-foot diameter stage. And it's all presented in the Spiegelworld carnival atmosphere with its beautifully historic spiegeltent, speak-easy bar and other curiosities. It all adds up to the best night out you will have this summer.

When I was 11 I went to an amusement park and refused to get on a ferris wheel.  So a couple years ago I made a list of things I wanted to do and riding a ferris wheel was on it.   Last week I saw that the rodeo and carnival was in town and I was ecstatic. I was determined to ride the ferris wheel. As we got there we decided to play a couple games to calm my nerves. Then when I stepped on I felt like a cat trying to balance on a log in the middle of a lake.  I also got to ride the merry go round all by my self! I felt like a celebrity.  The carnival was so empty we pretty much were the only ones there. It was weird screaming and having everyone know that it was me.

One of the statues celebrating athletics and Chinese culture at Yalujiang Park along the banks of the Yalu River in Dandong, China.  The Yalu River (Yalujiang) is the main geographic boundary between North Korea to the south and China to the north.  At the river's mouth, as it empties into the Yellow Sea is the town of Dandong with a population of roughly 750,000 (quite small by Chinese standards) that was originally built as a defense against Korean invasion (along with other barriers such as the Hushan section of the Great Wall 15 kilometers out of town to the east).  Currently, Dandong is a bit of an unusual town in that a lot of its population is North Korean refugees which lend to a good mix of Korean & Chinese cultures (among food, music, etc.).  Connecting the two countries...is an interesting set of bridges.  Originally, there was an eleven-arch steel bridge connecting the two countries which -- according to all signage in the area was bombed to smithereens by the Americans in 1950 during the Korean War.  In the subsequent years, the Koreans have completely dismantled their side of the remains, leaving only the cement pilings.  The Chinese have turned their side into a park -- Yalu Duanqiao (Yalu Broken Bridge) -- which, for a small fee of 25 RMB (about $6), you can have a stroll and enjoy the views over the river into the adjoining ""town"" of Sinuiju, North Korea, and also of the Dandong skyline (if you can call it that) and out to sea.  Speaking of Sinuiju, it's a rather interesting...illusion.  Yes, it's a town, but the bizarre part of it is that the North Korean government has put a few amusement rides -- a roller coaster, a Ferris wheel -- within sight of China to give the impression that times are fine in North Korea.  From my own perspective, I think I saw three people there on the shore during the day.  At night, I saw maybe two or three lights in the entire town.  If you didn't know it was there, you would swear that it's just countryside.  (For those who are curious as to what North Korea looks like at night, do a Google search:  satellite image North Korea by night; it's a little stunning.)  Since the original bridge was bombed into near-oblivion in 1950, a new one had to be built and is directly next to the original.  It's called the Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge.  As I was wandering along the Broken Bridge, I saw a number of trucks, a train or two, and a few buses...all leaving North Korea and heading into China.  I didn't see one vehicle, of any type, heading southward.  I certainly don't have a good grasp of the local economics, in terms of licit or illicit trade, nor do I need to as I don't know if I'll be spending much more time in the vicinity.  All in all, Dandong is one of those quirky towns that I'm glad to say I've seen with my own eyes.  In one day there, I managed to see North Korea closer than I ever imagined I would (including singing with 4 North Korean waitresses at the Pyongyang North Korean Restaurant on Bawei Lu -- excellent Korean food, for anyone travelling this way), a few nice parks, and the easternmost (to date, anyway) section of the Great Wall of China."
