With her dark sea magic and her ability to grow to enormous kraken like proportions and claim passing ships as her own, the superstitious seek to appease her greedy and tempestuous nature with offerings of gold, jewels and shrimp, of which she is partial, cast over board for safe passage on the seas. Her watery abode is at the bottom of an abyssal ravine in the skeletal remains of an ancient leviathan, surrounded by a garden of shipwrecks and the bones of drowned mariners. Only the brave or the very foolish seek her advice, for the sea witch is cunning and devious and the bargains she strikes are always rigged in her favour and she is not averse to bending the rules to get what she wants, and what Ursula really wants is to be ruler over the ocean and everything it.   One dark night, when the sky was as black as ink, Ursula rose from the depths into a secluded cove by a vast dense forest. She had been summoned by a frail looking old pedlar woman who standing on a wooden jetty holding the conch shell that had summoned her. Angry at being summoned like some dog fish and by an old hag, Ursula lashed out with her tentacles. But with a quick gesture of her hand, a bolt of green light sparked from the old womans fingers and struck the sea witchs tentacles with a sizzling crack, leaving blistering marks. Gnashing her teeth in pain, Ursula retracted her tentacles and glared at the pedlar woman. Do not mistake this frail appearance for weakness Sea Witch, for I am Grimhilde, former apprentice to the Powerful Sorcerer Yensid and once Queen of these lands and unless you wish to be turned into calamari you should listen to what I have to say for I have a deal to make with you. Ursula conceded and listened to the Hags proposal.  My mirror has shown me that four tides ago, you rose from your abode and claimed a ship as your own and dragged it to the depths   As is my right as Witch of the Sea! Ursula cut in. Grimhilde twitched her hand in warning and Ursula fell silent and Grimhilde continued that ship had something of mine on it, a chest. I had sent my pirate servant to claim it for me, which he successfully did, however the key that opens said chest was lost to me during your attack.  Ursula was growing impatient, why not smash the chest open and be done with it? Grimhilde explained that the chest is protected by magic and can only be opened by the key which has the counter spell on it. She went onto say that her mirror had shown that the key was claimed by a little mermaid who witnessed the attack and saved the Prince who was wearing the key on a chain round his neck. And that is why I now find myself of need of your assistance for I am now in a fortunate position to kill two birds with one stone so to speak. The mermaid will be paying you a visit in three tides time. She is a curious soul and wishes to visit the world above and believes you can help her, and so you shall, but of course payment is required.  Grimhilde told Ursula the specific payments required to which she replied But what do I get out of this? Why should I help you? I have no wish to help love sick mermaids let alone a fallen Queen. Did I fail to mention that this little mermaid is King Tritons youngest daughter? At this revelation Ursulas interest was hooked, The Sea King would do anything to get his precious daughter back, even surrender that which your heart desires The Trident! Ursula said triumphantly with it I shall finally be able to rule the sea and all its spoils shall bow to my power! However, if you fail to bring me what I have asked, you shall be summoned again Sea Witch and no amount of bargaining shall save your tentacles. Do we have a deal? Grimhilde asked.  Oh I shall help that poor unfortunate soul and then her fathers trident shall belong to me! Yes, we have a bargain. And with a cackling laugh Ursula sunk back beneath the waves.   Three tides later, just as The Hag had said, the mermaid entered Ursulas domain asking for Ursulas help. My dear, sweet child of course I shall help you, thats what I do and your Prince is quiet the catch isnt he? The potion I brew will turn you into a human for six tides, thats three daysin those three days you must get the prince to fall in love with you or else you shall turn back into a mermaid, and you shall belong to me. Do we have a deal? The little mermaid agreed to Ursulas deal and the Sea Witch continued there is one matter we must discuss, the subject of payment. But I dont have  That trinket round your neck? Yes hand it over, this shall do as one part of the payment I have nothing else to give Two legs, two payments, what I want from you isyour voice. I hear it is quite enchanting. The little mermaid sadly agreed to the Sea Witchs bargain and sung her voice into Ursulas shell necklace where it glowed bright and golden. Sea Witch then brewed a potion to transform the mermaids tail into a lovely pair of human legs. Clasping it in her hands the mermaid swam up and up to shore of the Princes Kingdom to drink the potion.    Ursula returned to the secluded cove and found The Hag, Grimhilde, waiting for her. Everything thing went swimmingly. Soon King Tritons daughter will be mine, and then Ill make him writhe and I shall have the Trident! Yes yes yes, but did you bring your side of the bargain? Ursula, smiling wickedly, handed over the key and the shell necklace containing the voice of the mermaid to Grimhilde, who took them in her old, wrinkled hands with a gloating look in her eyes.  At last, I have everything required to undo my spell and once again become the fairest and most powerful in the land!!

Press Release: ""RARE is pleased to present Strange Fruit, a group exhibition of photo-based work by Randall Bellows III (Denver, Colorado); Andrew Brodhead (Savannah, Georgia); Nicholas Hall (Brooklyn, New York); and Tom Lovelace (London, UK). Each artist depicts scenarios that are strange, disturbing, and even surreal in appearance, yet seem plausible and metaphorically true. The show runs from June 28 through August 9, and marks the artists' first exhibition at RARE.  Using himself as the protagonist in his photographs, Bellows is trailed by a dark, hazy figure that is a repository for the fears and difficulties he faced as a young child, the fallout of which haunts him to this day. Brodhead gives us images that haunt our very existence: plastic-wrapped bodies floating above gorgeous but vulnerable landscapes, showing us what we are losing by our consumption and waste, and the possibility of our becoming our own landfill in the mess we have created.  Hall scours magazines, books, and calendars for images he can re-interpret through the process of collaging seemingly antithetical elements (e.g., dinosaurs and submarines, hundreds of buildings with rooftops excised) to encourage us to view the world from a new perspective and explore its untapped possibilities. Lovelace confines his explorations to the gallery environment in a series of staged photos. Fusing photography, sculpture, and performance, he depicts a torso-less pair of legs balanced precariously atop Minimalist sculptures. By treating these reductive objects as playthings, Lovelace allows his work to oscillate between the mundane and the fantastical, thereby generating a sense of the bizarre, the surreal, but also the possible.  Primarily self-taught, Bellows has exhibited extensively throughout the Denver area. Brodhead received a BFA in photography from the Savannah College of Art and Design in 2009, and has exhibited in both Savannah and Atlanta. Hall obtained a BFA in painting in 2002 from the Pratt Institute and has participated in various group shows in New York. Lovelace received a post-graduate diploma in art history at Goldsmiths College, University of the Arts, London. His work has been shown in one-person and group exhibitions throughout the UK, and in Denmark and Italy.""  Show runs from June 28 to August 9, 2012"

The tip of the tail of a new born rattler ends in a smooth rounded, slightly pear-shaped, ""button,"" which is the first segment of the future rattle. As the young snake grows it sheds its skin, usually several times a year. Each shed skin adds a new, loosely overlapped and interlocked segment to the rattle. The more a Rattlesnake sheds, the more segments are added to its rattle. When the snake vibrates its tail, the segments click together to produce the buzzing rattle sound. If the string of rattle segments ends in a smooth rounded button, all the segments are there and the rattle is complete. If the rattle string ends in a squarish or tiered nubbin, the rattle has been broken and some segments have been lost.

The Police Commissioner accompanied the RWA BATT to the 5th Arrondissement, where a meeting was held with the Municipal Authorities. The main issues raised with regards to security concerns were related to freedom of movement, kidnappings and the destruction of property. All of these issues have had a detrimental effect on the businesses of the 5th Arrondissement. The authorities expressed their thanks for the positive working relationship with the MINUSCA forces, especially the RWA BATT, and the presence of both static security points, and active patrols. ..The Police Commissioner then proceeded to the 3rd Arrondissement, where he met with the Mayor. Again the major issue raised by the Authorities was freedom of movement, and its impact on business and education, as teachers fear coming to work in the 3rd Arrondissement. The Mayor also raised concerns regarding weapons in the community, and had confiscated four grenades, which were collected on the 05 October by an UNMAS team for safe destruction. ..The visit ended with a meeting with the Imam of the Central Mosque, and a foot patrol through the 3rd Arrondissement to PK5. The Police Commissioner, and his team engaged with members of the population, shop and kiosk owners, enquiring about their concerns. The population expressed their wish for security in the district, and requested more visits of this nature to discuss measures which could be taken to improve the situation, including the return of the National Security Forces.

You're too old to stand a chance; I'm everything you've ever feared: This world-consuming child-eater hungers like a Langolier! A fiend beyond your foulest nightmares, for I'm not of this dimension; Just like Giygas, my true form exceeds your feeble comprehension! Lesser evils shrink before me; ask my old pal, Henry Bowers. Watch me crash your crappy Carnival and make the spirits cower: Drop your Great Milenko faster than a Disney record label; Cutting jugulars of Juggalos, I make it extra-painful!

The brief, simply entitled Fluttering Wings, provided me with an opportunity to explore the mental associations a western audience has with specific patterns and textures found in nature;  in particular those of the moth and the butterfly. Rust dyeing techniques were used to recreate the subtle patterns found on a domesticated Silk moth while melted interfacing gave the piece a contorted abdomen-like texture, the combination of the two techniques created an unpleasant juxtaposition of fragility and strength.

It also marks the area where the remains of some hundred Covenanters  executed in the nearby Grassmarket are buried. As was the custom and practice most were beheaded and their heads placed on spikes above the gates into Edinburgh - the Netherbow Gate which once stood at the top of Canongate, was a populars one. Also several martyrs had their heads and hands and arms hacked off and sent to their home locality as a gruesome message to any one else minded to resist the King's will. The last line of the inscription is literally true -The most part of them lies here.     The inscription reads:  Halt passenger take heed what thou dost see This tomb doth shew for what some men did die Here lies interr'd the dust of these who stood Gainst perjury resisting unto blood Adhering to the Covenants and Laws Establishing the same which was the Cause Then their lives were sacrificed unto the Lust Or Prelatist's abjur'd though here their dust Lies mixt with murders and other crew Whom justice did justly to death pursue But as for this in them no cause was found Worthy of death but only they were found Constant and steadfast zealous witnessing For the prerogatives of CHRIST their king Which truths were feared by famous Guthrie's head And all along to Mr Ranwick's blood They did endure the wrath of enemies Reproaches torments deaths and injuries But yet they're these who from such troubles came And now triumph in glory with the LAMB    From May 27th 1661 that the noble Marquess of Argyle suffered to the 17th of Febr 1688 that Mr James Ranwick suffr'd were executed at Edinburgh about an hundred of Noblemen Gentlemen Ministers & others noble martyrs for JESUS CHRIST. The most part of them lies here.  This Tomb was erected anno 1706.  Thanks to the efforts of the Scottish Covenanters Memorials Association and the Greyfriars Kirkyard Trust (www.greyfriars.org) work has been put in hand to save the monument that is itself suffering the effects of age. Special silicone solution is being injected into the stone to hold it together. It was hoped to re cut the bible that is at the bottom of the monument but instead a brass plate has been inscribed and inserted below."

Starring Vincent Price, Giacomo Rossi-Stuart, Antonio Corevi, Emma Danieli, Franca Bettoja, Christi Courtland, Carolyn De Fonseca, and Umberto Raho. Directed by Libaldo Ragona and Sidney Salkow. I'm not sure why this film is as underrated as it is.  ( Spoiler Alert)  This is an amazing, depressing and in many ways brilliant film based on the Richard Matheson classic novel ""I Am Legend"". Vincent Price effectively conveys the terror and despair of being the last living man on an Earth that is now overrun with vampires and/or zombies. The depiction of Price's day to day bleak existence is a moving and powerful thing to behold and the continual menace of the hordes of zombies is creepy in the same way as was later depicted in ""Night of the Living Dead"". In fact, as noted by others here, one can not watch the scenes where the zombies lay siege to Price's boarded up house and attack his car without recognizing how close these scenes would later be copied by George Romero in his classic zombie films. If you are a fan of horror film history or just looking for a classic and unique film with an interesting story, track down this lost gem. Robert Morgan (Vincent Price) is the last man on earth, as far as he can tell. A plague killed everyone else on the planet several years ago. He was immune to it, and can only guess why. Vampires that were formerly human attack Morgan's home every night  Morgan's days are spent shoring up his home against the vampire hordes, picking up supplies in the abandoned city, and eliminating his enemies by searching out and destroying the bloodsuckers while they sleep. He maintains mirrors and garlic strands around his house and fashions stakes on his lathe to use on the walking dead. He also conducts experiments on the bacteria that caused this plague in an effort to find a cure.  He remembers the early days of the plague, when his former friend and lab partner, Ben Cortman (Giacomo Rossi-Stuart) tried to warn Morgan of what was to come. Morgan dismissed his fears and continued life as usual.  The vampires outside Morgan's home are led by Ben Cortman, who has made it his personal mission to kill Morgan. ""Morgan, come out!"" is the nightly chant that torments him.  He remembers the disease blanketing the earth. His daughter Kathy (Christi Courtland) fell ill and went blind. His wife Virg (Emma Danieli) was horrified and wanted to get help, but any reported case of plague would result in immediate government pickup, death and cremation of the body. Before leaving for work, Morgan ordered Virg not to call anyone, but, tormented by the little girl's cries, she did. As Morgan arrived home, he saw the government truck leaving. Kathy was gone.  His solitary existence is painful. He gets on the radio every day, calling out on different frequencies, trying to find another human still alive. In his tortured dreams, he remembers when his wife returned from the dead to seek his blood, after she succumbed to the plague. Because he couldn't bear to throw her body in the cremation pit where others were taken, he buried her himself--and when she came back from the dead as a vampire, he had to drive a stake through her heart.  One day, to his amazement, he finds a dog. He is so excited to have a companion that he overlooks several signs that all is not right with the animal. Eventually, he realizes that the dog is also infected and that he must kill it.  While burying the dog, Morgan encounters Ruth Collins (Franca Bettoia), a woman walking through the park in the sunshine! Even though he's suspicious of her story of how she survived, he takes her home with him. She reacts violently to a garland of garlic cloves he brings out, but she claims that she's always had a weak stomach. Morgan catches her injecting herself with something, and she's forced to admit that she too is infected but that she and others like her have developed a serum that lets them control the disease. By regular injections, they keep the disease in check: they are able to live in the daylight and do not turn to vampirism. Ruth also warns Morgan that her people are coming for him because, in his zeal to kill vampires, he has been killing people like her who have the disease under control. Morgan injects Ruth with some of his own blood and cures her of the disease completely. His blood is the permanent cure that Ruth and others like her have been searching to find.  At this moment, however, the soldiers come for him. Before Ruth can tell them that Morgan has found a cure, he is surrounded and shot. As he stumbles to his death, he tells the crowds that they are freaks and that he is ""the last man on earth""! "

Scared to do so, but worth it in the end. Good grade, good feelings. My cousin lifted me so I could reach. Right leg over, sitting of the ledge like how people would sit on a horse. Now left leg, I was sitting fully on the ledge. She held me tight around my waist, I couldnt reach my camera so I told her to let go. Her arms release and Im frozen. Scared and shivering from the northwest gusty winds. Not being able to move, my sister hands me my camera. I take photos from different angles to see if you the viewer can see what I was doing. Thoughts running through my head of falling, I close my eyes and open and I was still there looking over Portland. I thought to myself try not to look down, but knowing me I did. I see people looking up at me thinking what is she doing. I see cars gliding from street to street. I took the last couple photos and shouted Im done, get me down. Because I wanted to get on the ground as fast as I can. When I finally got to my feet, I took a deep breath and felt.. accomplished. "

Feared for its aggressive nature, they cross paths with humans more so than any other shark species as they are capable of existing in both fresh and salt water. Adult female bull sharks average 7.9 ft in length and typically weigh 290 lb, whereas the slightly smaller adult male averages 7.4 ft and tips scales at about 210 lb. Bull sharks have a bite force of up to 600 kilograms (1,300 lb), pound for pound the highest among all investigated cartilaginous fishes. Listed as one of the 3 most dangerous sharks on the planet, they are responsible for more attacks than any other species and were the true inspiration for the novel JAWS as they were the species most likely responsible for the famous 1916 New Jersey coast attacks which the book is based on and NOT the Great White!"

Trailer The Brides were played by: Andree Melly as Ginaand Marie Devereux as the Village Girl. Baroness Meinster"" was played by Martita Hunt and Marianne Danielle was Yvonne Monlaur. Greta was played by Freda Jackson : Best Scene: When the innkeepers (Greta was played by Freda Jackson) daughter (Marie Devereux) falls prey to the Baron and is buried, she is interred in the churchyard. Van Helsing goes one night to investigate her grave, and finds Greta Freda Jackson laying with her ear to the mound, muttering into the freshly turned earth. Yes my dear, I know its dark. No, I cant help. Youve got to push. The scene has a really macabre intensity, and the unmistakable allusions to childbirth play out perfectly, with Freda, already established as having nursed the young Baron from infancy, playing the part of an encouraging midwife as the innkeepers daughters pale hand slowly breaks through the ground and she is born as a vampire, emerging at last from her coffin, pale and fanged. Best Dialogue/Line:  Baroness: Who is it that is not afraid? Van Helsing: Only God has no fear. Baroness: Why have you come here? Van Helsing: To find your son. Baroness Meinster: Then you know who I am? Van Helsing: I know who you were  Director Terence Fisher's follow-up to the hit Horror of Dracula was one of only a few Hammer vampire films to not feature Christopher Lee in the lead role. David Peel was instead cast as Baron Meinster, with Peter Cushing returning as Dr. Van Helsing to combat the bloodsucking fiend.  The Brides of Dracula is the first sequel to 'The Horror of Dracula'. This film does not have Christopher Lee, or Dracula for that matter, but is among the most lush of the Hammer films. Release Date: 1960 Directed By: Terence Fisher Written By: Jimmy Sangster, Peter Bryan, and Edward Percy Peter Cushing as Doctor Van Helsing Martina Hunt as Baroness Meinster Yvonne Mauler as Marianne Danielle Freda Jackson as Greta:  David Peel as Baron Meinster The young and beautiful French schoolteacher Marianne (Yvonne Mauler) is abandoned by her coach driver in an isolated village. When she arrives at an inn seeking shelter, she ignores the warnings of others and goes with Baroness Meinster (Martina Hunt) to stay with her at her castle. There she meets the Baroness handsome son, Baron Meinster (David Peel), who has his leg chained to a wall. He tells her that his mother has taken his right to the lands and imprisoned him. She steals the keys and sets him free, and his mother and their servant Greta (Freda Jackon) become terribly upset. The Baroness is bitten and killed by her evil son, who we learn is a vampire. When Greta shows the body to Marianne she runs away and is found by Van Helsing (Peter Cushing). The Baron, now free, turns his mother into a vampire, as well as, a little later, a pretty girl from the village. Meanwhile, Greta has become his human servant. He sets his eyes on making Marianne his as well, and only Van Helsing can stop his reign of evil. This is the first of Hammers sequels to their classic, influential, and hugely successful The Horror of Dracula. Christopher Lee does not return and there is no Dracula, nor is there any mention of him in the movie, aside from the narration at the beginning which tells that he has many followers. Van Helsing, though, does return making him the most direct link to the aforementioned film. Fisher finely directs The Brides of Dracula, and it ranks as one of the most lush and sumptuous of all of the Hammer films from the period. The sets are beautiful, as are the costumes worn by the cast. The film is always stunning to look at, a truly lavish production in every sense of the word, despite the surely low budget. There are some very exciting and memorable moments in The Brides of Dracula, and even before Cushing ever sets into a single frame, there is already a wonderful set-up. One such moment is when the Baroness talks about her son introducing him for the very first time. Its a great bit of dialogue, and of acting from Hunt, and it really sets up the tone, as well as the characters and story. Another potent, and ultimately creepy, scene comes when the pretty vamp is resurrected while Greta cheers her on. Both the first confrontation between the Baron and Van Helsing and the climax are very thrilling. In fact, the later is one of the finest of any and all of Hammers movies. And, the ending is simply awesome and features one of the coolest ways to dispose of a vampire, ever! Hunt isnt the only one who gives a great performance, as the whole cast is just excellent. Cushing is his always amazing self, proving yet again that he is the definitive Van Helsing. He remains heroic and classy throughout the movie. Peel makes for a great villain - So good, that any disappointment over Lee not appearing in The Brides of Dracula fade quickly. There are few greater complements that can be paid to a horror star than that. Peels Baron is sly, seductive, classy, and outright evil. Mauler makes for a likeable and beautiful heroine in the movie, and in keeping with the Hammer tradition both of the vampire brides to the Baron are very sexy and attractive as well. The wonderful acting in this film is strengthened by great dialogue, and the script is perhaps the best in all of vampire movie history. This is an amazing film that has rightfully taken its place as one of Hammers very best films, and well lives up to its legacy. No list of the best of Hammers work is complete without including The Brides of Dracula, and no true fan of bloodsucker cinema should miss it. "

It was one of many series influenced by The Twilight Zone and Science Fiction Theatre, though it ultimately proved influential in its own right. In the un-aired pilot, the series was called Please Stand By, but ABC rejected that title. Series creator Leslie Stevens retitled it The Outer Limits. With a few changes, the pilot aired as the premiere episode, ""The Galaxy Being"".  Writers for The Outer Limits included creator Stevens and Joseph Stefano (screenwriter of Hitchcock's Psycho), who was the series' first-season producer and creative guiding force. Stefano wrote more episodes than any other writer for the show. Future Oscar winning screenwriter Robert Towne (Chinatown) would write ""The Chameleon"", which was also the final episode filmed for the first season. Two especially notable second-season episodes ""Demon with a Glass Hand"" and ""Soldier"" were written by Harlan Ellison, with the latter episode winning a Writers' Guild Award. The former was for several years the only episode of The Outer Limits available on laser-disc.  The first season combined science-fiction and horror, while the second season was more focused on 'hard' science-fiction stories, dropping the recurring ""scary monster"" motif of the first season. Each show in the first season was to have a monster or creature as a critical part of the story line. First-season writer and producer Joseph Stefano believed that this element was necessary to provide fear, suspense, or at least a center for plot development. This kind of story element became known as ""the bear"". This device was, however, mostly dropped in the second season when Stefano left. (Two first-season episodes without a ""bear"" are ""The Forms of Things Unknown"" and ""Controlled Experiment"" the first of which was shot in a dual format as science-fiction for The Outer Limits and as a Thriller for a pilot for an unmade series The Unknown. Actor Barry Morse who starred in ""Controlled Experiment"" states that this episode also was made as a pilot for an unrealized science-fiction comedy series.[2] It is the only comic episode of The Outer Limits. Earlier season one episodes with no ""bear"" were ""The Hundred Days of the Dragon"" and ""The Borderland"" made before the ""bear"" convention was established. Second season episodes with a ""bear"" are ""Keeper of the Purple Twilight"", ""The Duplicate Man"", and ""The Probe"". Bears appear near the conclusion of second season episodes ""Counterweight"", ""The Invisible Enemy"", and ""Cold Hands, Warm Heart"".)  The ""bear"" in ""The Architects of Fear"", the monstrously-altered Allen Leighton, was judged by some of ABC's local affiliate stations to be so frightening that they broadcast a black screen during the ""Thetan's"" appearances, effectively censoring most of the show's last act. In other parts of the United States the ""Thetan"" footage was tape delayed until after the 11 o'clock evening news. In still others, it was not shown at all. (Unlike today where all film series are transferred to videotape for transmission, from the 1950s to about the mid-1980s all film series were broadcast directly off the film print via telecine.)  The show's first season had distinctive music by Dominic Frontiere, who doubled as Production Executive; the second season featured music by Harry Lubin, with a variation of his Fear theme for One Step Beyond being heard over the end titles. Another tangible that marked the series was good talent that played different characters and aliens on the show: Among the actors who performed in the original shows were stars like David McCallum, Jill Haworth, William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Martin Sheen, Adam West, Bruce Dern, Robert Culp, Sally Kellerman, and future Oscar winner Robert Duvall."
