People in our culture think they should never be unhappy. They think that being unhappy is unnatural. They try to make it go away. They take pills or they go to therapy to ""fix"" themselves. They blame themselves or others for their suffering. We need to understand that sadness is as much a part of life as joy. It would be easy just to get bitter and cold while focusing on the dark side, but there is also an amazing, wonderful side of life. If you look for it, there is true magic all around us. Maybe that sounds trite to the hardened, self-protective modern ego, but there is magiv in this miraculous life. If you open yourself up, you do make yourself vulnerable to pain but the deeper the pain you experience, the deeper joy you have.

Local records indicate that whilst this was the first official burial, ceremonies took place in the area of the Old Ballaarat Cemetery in the late 1840's and thereafter, which was even before the discovery of gold in Ballarat and the subsequent Gold Rushes that drew people to the city from around the world.   Allow the elegant and ornate Victorian gates on the corner of Macarthur Street and Creswick Road to usher you into a world of grand and simple monuments to the dead, and to a slice of Ballarat's fantastic history.  The Old Ballaarat Cemetery is filled with historical figures from Ballarat's past as many burials were early settlers who were looking to make their fortune on the goldfields. People mentioned in my own photostream are amongst those buried here; Richard Henry Sutton of Sutton's Music Store in Sturt Street; George and Clara Crocker who dedicated windows in St Peter's Church of England to their sons who died during the Great War; Thomas Stoddart who made Ballarat a city of marble statues; and Henry Richards Caselli who designed so many beautiful and iconic Ballarat buildings.  Two important monuments in not just Ballarat's, but Australia's, history were erected in the cemetery following from the armed insurrection of 1854 - the Eureka uprising; the Eureka Diggers' Monument in 1856 and the Officers and Soldiers Monument in 1879.  Situated in the centre of the cemetery, is the original Victorian rotunda built in 1892 to the designs of James and Piper and J. C. Smith.  The Rotunda has recently been restored to its original splendour.  Cemetery records show 35,000 interments have taken place since 1856, with 18,000 prior to 1884.   Appropriately for a city, once the wealthiest in the world, because of the Gold Rushes, in 1907 gold was discovered in the Old Ballaarat Cemetery when grave diggers were preparing a grave for a Mr. T. C. Thomas.    The 1920 gatehouse building was restored in 1997."

All girls. All rich. All of us, except those on scholarships. We don't appreciate what we have; we never have. We may be grateful, but we have no idea how hard it is for the rest of the world. I'm tired of being sheltered, tired of being around people that do nothing but talk about each other and whine about our privileged lives. It numbs my emotions, it dulls my mind, and I want to be better than that. I didn't quote the lyrics for their reference to alcohol--I never drink. It's just that sensation of feeling completely alone among this mass of people that have everything in common. I'm a girl, I'm rich, I'm unappreciative, but I want something different. So the switch was hit (not off, but on) somewhere along the line, and I started to realize how much more there was to life. I feel nothing for where I am, and I'll find somewhere better."

This sentiment is felt most clearly at the funeral service for a Police Officer killed in the line of duty.  If you find yourself at a CPD funeral but you are not part of the law enforcement community (i.e., Officer or family member) you had better be respectful because you are on hallowed ground... in a sacred space.  At these services, outsiders (guests) can sense the grief and the remorse felt by those Officers in attendance but most of all you can sense a feeling that says to everyone, This is our group.  This happened to us.  There is a palpable, underlying tension that can only be interpreted as, We will fix this problem, our problem.  And no one should think for one minute of getting in our way; of stopping us.    We all have our opinions about revenge and justice but trust me when I say there is absolutely no room for debate or discussion of those things at these services.  There is only profound sadness for the Officer's family and solemn respect for what needs to be done next.  If you look into the eyes of all of those in uniform at this service you'll see firsthand the CPD's resolve and determination to take care of one of their own.  It's an amazing, collective natural phenomenon.  Today, nine days after CPD Ofc. Clifton Lewis was gunned down (and thirteen days after he proposed to his long-time girlfriend on Christmas) two men were charged with his murder.    Farewell Clifton.  Your friendship and laughter will be dearly missed and your uniform will always remain empty to us.

I don't even remember what I uploaded last. I could look, but I just don't have the desire to right now. I'm not in the best place, mentally. so much going on, and so much sadness.   this is inspired by one of my best friends, who passed away November 18th. she was battling pancreatic cancer after being diagnosed last year. she was finally able to go home after several months and close calls, and was doing well, until she had liver failure last month. she bounced back, even though doctors only gave her days to live. just a couple weeks later, she developed a GI bleed, but doctors couldn't pinpoint where. after a long talk with her husband, she decided against treatment, and requested medicine to keep her comfortable until her time passed. this is inspired by the internal bleeding she suffered. :(   words literally do not do her justice. she was such an amazing woman. I've decided to post one memory of her with each photo from here on out. so at the end of this description, that's what i'll do.  love your friends. tell them everyday. support them 100%. I just wish I was able to do more for her, and support her the way she supported me. I guess I just didn't know how to, but that just sounds like a fucking excuse.  I'm sorry I don't have more to say, or anything chipper. her death has hit me harder than I ever thought it could, so I need to process that before I can be truly happy again.  Tamarra Memory:  lemon bars. those were here ABSOLUTE favorite dessert (according to her of course). one time, while she was in the hospital, I made her some, and had to sneak them in to her. :) being the naughty girl she was, she snuck a tiny bite (she was having a procedure the next day, so no food night before. tsk tsk. ;)  ) she was so happy. :)  I made some tonight, because of this specific memory, but I can't bring myself to eat them. they just don't taste the same if I can't share them. I'm hoping she'll stop by and grab a bite though. :'(  she was an incredible artist. please check out her work, and don't let it be forgotten. I should've shared her work more when she was alive. bellamiastudio.smugmug.com/  "

I was particularly taken by this memorial which, if I'm correct, is of the Holly Mother grasping at the cross with the word ""Cling"" written on it staring up, to the heavens above. The look on her face really speaks to me, the creator of this art somehow captures both horror and sadness in Mary's face but not without also leaving in some hope. When I see imagery like this, it serves to remind me why the Christian Faith is as large and meaningful in the lives of as many of my friends as I know it is. This is why no matter what faith I personally subscribe too,  I always consider it a blessing whenever anybody sends me a blessing. "

""When I was younger,"" Tawakoli said to me, ""I did not want to leave my country for anything."" Throughout decades of war and despotic regimes, he stayed put. He survived the Taliban, a doubly dangerous task as a musician and a Hazara. ""But now, I am ready to leave,"" he says. There is a brittle tone in his voice that reveals his sadness. It is the sound of resign. He is weary of fearing for his own safety and that of his wife and children. For the first time in a long career dedicated to this violent country, Safdar is ready to seek peace elsewhere. The only problem is - he has nowhere to go. "

Osa died at the young age of 34, she was said to have been expecting. The story is told that her husband came home drunk one night in 1911 and he had brought her flowers. A argument broke out and it is said he slapped her and she fell down the steps and this act killed her and her unborn child.  After getting out of the conviction for her death he built this statue in honor of his undying love for her. Ironically the statue is walking down stairs and was once holding flowers in her hands, but over time her hands are gone, yet there is a noticeable mark on the side of her face resembling a handprint. Several attempts over the years have been made to remove this place and even with sandblasting it has returned, giving her the name of the ""Slapped Lady"" It has been said the statue has cried real tears and that even in the dead of winter her belly is warm to the touch and some have said to have felt the faint heartbeat of her baby. Her sad story may not be written on this statue yet if you stare into her eyes you can see and feel her sadness."

Taking pictures just has not been the most important thing for me at this point, but nevertheless I will continue squeezing the shutter whenever I can.  Hopefully, we will all be able to see dramatic transformation of these areas back into their original beauty, but it is clearly a long road ahead.    If you live in the area and wish to help, please contact me and I will send you a list of volunteer centers throughout Miyagi as well as a list of important equipment to bring with you.  If you do decide to volunteer, please go with an organized group and bring the necessary equipment.  I don't mean to frighten anyone, but I was notified again today that there still are dangerous areas.  Don't go alone, please.    Here is a video that I took of the area the same day I took these pictures:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=CazswZd454o  The area that these pictures were taken, was utterly obliterated by the tsunami.  After a few hours of hauling items back and forth between my friends' destroyed home, I started to get a headache and feel sick from the fumes.  In my last post, I also mentioned that I had heard of people setting off explosions and starting fires from trying to light their cigarettes.    We worked amidst pure devastation for about 5 Hours, however we were only able to salvage a handful of their things. Sometimes it was hard to know what was theirs, since the tsunami had swept a whole city worth of belongings through the first floor of their home.  Surprisingly, the four-year-old house was in pretty good shape despite the fact that it was blown back off of its foundation about 200 feet and sat about 10-15 degrees off of level (in the video I said 60 feet, but I meant to say 60 meters.  The distance and angle is still a total guess, but you can judge for yourself in the pictures/video).  The structure of house was in such good condition, that we were able to walk up to the second floor and salvage most of the dry, smaller items.  Their daughter was just given a brand new bed and desk-set as an elementary graduation present, but we unfortunately could not take it out.     The reason we needed to go and salvage what we could as quickly as possible was because the house, although it did not look like it, was sitting in the middle of a road.  The city and self defense force had given them  only a few more days to clear out before they would have to bulldoze it down.    I asked the family if they had tsunami insurance, but apparently there is no tsunami insurance.  They will receive a small amount of money from the government, but it will not even come close to covering the damage they sustained.    The most dumbfounding part of that day for me was not surreal experience of walking through the total destruction of an entire town, but rather the laughing and smiling that came from a family who just lost everything- everything except each other.  Items and worldly possessions are of little value against the people we hold dear.  I tried to reciprocate the smiles, laughter, and healthy conversation (especially in light of the children), but it wasn't easy fighting off the grim emotions lurking below the surface.    This last weekend, I was able to volunteer for a short time in Downtown Ishinomaki and also take a few more pictures/video  The downtown area seems to be getting a lot more attention, and about half of the roads seem traversable.  Downtown also felt incredibly safe during the day time due to the dozens of police and military (both Japanese and US) walking the streets and distributing food and water at the camps.  I will post those pictures later this week.  I know my website is in shambles right now (I just have not had time), but I'm hoping to have it looking nicer as soon as possible.  I've never really sold anything from my website, but I'm going to donate all of the money I earn from ANY of the pictures I sell (not just the quake photos) to Red Cross Japan for at least the next year.  Please take it into consideration. Here is my site:  www.carstenKnoche.com  In addition, I contributed many of my pictures to QUAKEBOOK.org, and if you have never heard this organization, PLEASE check them out as well.  All of Quakebook's revenue will also go towards the Red Cross Japan.   www.quakebook.org/   Lastly, you can contribute directly to Red Cross Japan here:  www.jrc.or.jp/english/relief/l4/Vcms4_00002070.html  Thank you very much for facing this tragedy with us. With cooperation, strength, and perseverance, we can accomplish anything.  Take care, Carsten Knoche"

Although we made it out quite late, we were able to help a little by distributing water and food to a few people.  Although downtown Ishinomaki was hit very hard by the tsunami, it was very uplifting to see the progress that had already been made.  Military supply camps, squads of police, and groups of volunteers were all working tirelessly in restoration.  The downtown area seemed to be getting far more attention than any of the other areas I've visited, but rightfully so, since it has a far higher population density.    Despite the incredible progress that had been made, there is clearly still a lot to do.  The chorus of destroyed boats, cars, and houses again echoed throughout the town.  Oil-logged muck permeated through the hills of debris and toxic smells wafted through the air, but people managed to keep their spirits up regardless.   - Hide quoted text -  The most somber part of the day for me, was after we left the downtown area and made our way up to Hiyoriyama park.  I would sometimes come up to Hiyoriyama to view the cherry blossoms, watch the sunrise, or relax after archery.  Every time I went up to the park, I was stunned by the natural beauty and panoramic view of this sprawling city creeping to edge of the ocean.  This time, however, I felt as though I was punched in the gut with the starkest realization of utter destruction that I had experienced until this point.  The once beautiful view of a thriving city reaching out into the ocean, was replaced with the surreal image of toppled homes and bare foundations.  A handful of cars weaving through nearly impassable roads created the only movement in what could easily be confused with a garbage dump or wasteland.   I know that eventually the area will be restored, but it will take a lot of work and time to heal the wounds.  If you would like to donate to Red Cross Japan, please visit their website here:  www.jrc.or.jp/english/relief/l4/Vcms4_00002070.html  Also, I have decided to donate all of the profits from any of the pictures sold on my website until at least March 11, 2012.    carstenknoche.com/march-25-2011-japan-earthquake-disaster/  Lastly, you can read more stories and see more pictures from a variety of different people by purchasing Quakebook.

Here is my story for it: So, Anna was walking one day to her friend Carly's house. As she walked in, she found her getting high off Cocaine. Anna screamed at her, calling her every name in the book. She stormed out of the house. That night, she was walking down the street and took a wrong turn. SHe ended up down an allyway, which happened to be a dead end. As she made her way through the small path, she tripped and fell over something. As she turned around, it was Carly. She was a slight shade of blue, her lips and nose very badly beaten. There was no life in her eyes. As it turned out, Carly was beaten to death because she did not pay her dealer in time.  From now on, Anna holds a slight guilt against herself, knowing that she could have done something better to help, than just yell. She visits her grave weekly, and recites the same lines (which are from the song lol)  ""Tell me what you gone and done now!  A gun would do the trick, get it over with,  You're better off...  To take all you've got and burn it on the spot,  To get high-igh, igh, igh (high-igh, igh, igh).""  So, yeah! I hope we get a good placing! :D  "
