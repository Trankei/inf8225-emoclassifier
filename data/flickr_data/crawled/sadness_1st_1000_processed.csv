sadness,http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3891/14197256617_98efc80750_z.jpg,0,5,"Vision of US nr 59 : Tenderloin, San Francisco, CA    SOCIAL WORK IN THE TENDERLOIN WILL KILL SOMETHING INSIDE OF YOU www.vice.com/read/social-work-in-the-tenderloin-will-kill...   The Tenderloin is widely acknowledged as the most hellish neighborhood in San Francisco. Out of the city's ten most violent crime plots, the Tenderloin is home to seven. Recent stats estimate the neighborhood has an average of three major crimes per hour, including one-third of the citys drug offenses, with a yearly mean of two crimes per resident. The population is made up of more than 6,000 homeless people and contains one-fourth of the citys HIV-positive drug users. Filthy sidewalks and vacant buildings peppered with single-occupancy hotel rooms provide a home to all levels of drugs and prostitution.  My friend Jenny has been employed as a social worker in the Tenderloin for several years now. Her tweets about it (things like: today: 4 dead clients, 1 murdered provider, 1 client defecated in the lobby, 1 dead dog, & 1 facebook friend posted pictures of nachos.) got me curious as to what her job is like. She was kind enough to answer some of my questions.   VICE: I imagine it varies greatly, but can you describe your average workday? Jenny: The first thing is getting through the door at 9 AM. We usually have to step over clients or random strangers passed out on the benches from drinking and/or using since God knows when. The smell is the first thing that hits youa stench of urine, feces, poor hygieneit's really at its strongest in the morning, but you get used to it throughout the day. Then we check our voicemail. Twenty messages from the same two or three clients who either scream their financial requests over and over, simply sit there and breathe, or tell you that witches are under their beds waiting for the next blood sacrifice. Paranoid clients like to fixate on witches, Satan, etc. Anyway, we get ready to open and hand out checks to the clients who are either on daily budgets, or who make random check requests. The budgeted clients are the most low-functioning, as they can be restricted to as little as $7 per day in order to curb their harm reduction. They'll go and spend that $7 on whatever piece of crack they can find, and then two hours later they're back, begging for more money. Clients will find some really brilliant ways to beg. When we're not dealing with clients out in the lobby, which can involve anything from handing out checks to cleaning up blood to clearing the floor for folks having seizures, we're usually dealing with the government agency assholes over at Social Security. I personally work with around 200 clients, so the paperwork and filing can be extraordinary. My average day starts at 9 AM and lasts until 7 or 8 PM.  You're in the Tenderloin, right? What's the deal with that area? Yeah, the Tenderloin is where the majority of our clients live in residential hotels (SROs). It's one of the two predominately black neighborhoods left in SF (the other is the Western Addition), and it's the center of the crack, heroin, and oxy drug culture, and it hosts the transgendered sex-worker scene. It's an incredible neighborhood. There's a preservation society that works really hard to keep the original buildings in place, so the 'Loin has an impressive architectural history, not to mention random shit like vintage fetish-magazine stores, pot dispensaries, and transgender strip clubs. It's literally located at the bottom of a giant hill (Nob Hill), where the old money sits and looks down on the poor black folk, so the geography of SF's class structure is more blatant than in other cities, I think. It's a fucked place: human shit smeared on the sidewalks, tweakers sitting on the corner dismantling doorknobs for hours, heroin users nodding out in the middle of the streets, drug dealers paying cornerstore owners $20 to sell in their stores, dudes pissing on your doorstep as you leave for work, etc. It's a weird, fascinating, and very hard place to live.  Why do you think so many of your clients are paranoid and/or disturbed? Why are my clients so fucked up? Traumatic backgrounds, PTSD, and severe mental illness (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and dementia are the most frequent cases we see). And whenever you combine a drug habit with compromised mental health, you usually get a mess of a brain. Abuse, rape, murder, suicide, waryou name it, they've experienced it. Most of our clients live with on-site case management and nursing staff, so their medication is monitored, but when they stop taking the meds, that's when psychotic breaks and fixations happen. I've been the subject of quite a few of these fixations. And even though our agency pushes the belief that housing is healthcare, the shit that goes down inside these residential hotels can be hard to stomach. A lot of our clients feel safer living on the streets.   How does being in the midst of so much mental illness affect you emotionally?  Man, social work is so fucking weird. People think you're a saint. It takes a certain person to do that kind of work, is what I hear a lot. Fuck that. When you're young, you can afford to have ideals and believe in stuff, and think that what you're doing matters, but after watching grown men shit themselves and sometimes try to eat their own shit, not to mention the countless number of times I've had to pick people off the floor and put them back in their wheelchairs because they've been drinking since 6 AM and can't even sit up straight, your measly 32K salary starts to matter a helluva lot more than social justice.  I think I got into social work because I had this idea of it somehow killing my ego. It seems silly, but it felt very real at the time. There's a sadness to watching your idealism and convictions go to shit. Not to mention that working in such a thankless and fucked system will kill a sacred part of you. I feel tired. For the most part, people do not want help. They want money or they want drugs or they want death.   What you do seems important, though. There must be some goodness in it, too, right? I feel like you tweet sometimes about people bringing you weird things they see as gifts or saying nice, if totally bizarre things. Are there moments that help balance the heavy? I don't really think of what I do as important, because days are days and everyone is dying and who am I to think anything of anything. But yes, there are moments, there is goodness. Today a client brought me a huge drawing he made of a tree in Golden Gate Park. It must've taken him hours. He said he drew every leaf. I told him the line work was amazing, and he said, An amazing tree for an amazing woman. And then he asked me, When is the Fourth of July? Sometimes moments like that are enough.      @blakebutler"

As we approached the far end of the South Pool the crowds had dispersed and we discovered why when came across these two girls. They were leaving Father's Day messages for their Dad, Mr. Thomas Tong. At this moment it all became so real and a feeling a raw emotion took a hold of my wife and I. Tears were inevitable. It wasn't just a name. It was a father, a husband and a friend.

Taking pictures just has not been the most important thing for me at this point, but nevertheless I will continue squeezing the shutter whenever I can.  Hopefully, we will all be able to see dramatic transformation of these areas back into their original beauty, but it is clearly a long road ahead.    If you live in the area and wish to help, please contact me and I will send you a list of volunteer centers throughout Miyagi as well as a list of important equipment to bring with you.  If you do decide to volunteer, please go with an organized group and bring the necessary equipment.  I don't mean to frighten anyone, but I was notified again today that there still are dangerous areas.  Don't go alone, please.    Here is a video that I took of the area the same day I took these pictures:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=CazswZd454o  The area that these pictures were taken, was utterly obliterated by the tsunami.  After a few hours of hauling items back and forth between my friends' destroyed home, I started to get a headache and feel sick from the fumes.  In my last post, I also mentioned that I had heard of people setting off explosions and starting fires from trying to light their cigarettes.    We worked amidst pure devastation for about 5 Hours, however we were only able to salvage a handful of their things. Sometimes it was hard to know what was theirs, since the tsunami had swept a whole city worth of belongings through the first floor of their home.  Surprisingly, the four-year-old house was in pretty good shape despite the fact that it was blown back off of its foundation about 200 feet and sat about 10-15 degrees off of level (in the video I said 60 feet, but I meant to say 60 meters.  The distance and angle is still a total guess, but you can judge for yourself in the pictures/video).  The structure of house was in such good condition, that we were able to walk up to the second floor and salvage most of the dry, smaller items.  Their daughter was just given a brand new bed and desk-set as an elementary graduation present, but we unfortunately could not take it out.     The reason we needed to go and salvage what we could as quickly as possible was because the house, although it did not look like it, was sitting in the middle of a road.  The city and self defense force had given them  only a few more days to clear out before they would have to bulldoze it down.    I asked the family if they had tsunami insurance, but apparently there is no tsunami insurance.  They will receive a small amount of money from the government, but it will not even come close to covering the damage they sustained.    The most dumbfounding part of that day for me was not surreal experience of walking through the total destruction of an entire town, but rather the laughing and smiling that came from a family who just lost everything- everything except each other.  Items and worldly possessions are of little value against the people we hold dear.  I tried to reciprocate the smiles, laughter, and healthy conversation (especially in light of the children), but it wasn't easy fighting off the grim emotions lurking below the surface.    This last weekend, I was able to volunteer for a short time in Downtown Ishinomaki and also take a few more pictures/video  The downtown area seems to be getting a lot more attention, and about half of the roads seem traversable.  Downtown also felt incredibly safe during the day time due to the dozens of police and military (both Japanese and US) walking the streets and distributing food and water at the camps.  I will post those pictures later this week.  I know my website is in shambles right now (I just have not had time), but I'm hoping to have it looking nicer as soon as possible.  I've never really sold anything from my website, but I'm going to donate all of the money I earn from ANY of the pictures I sell (not just the quake photos) to Red Cross Japan for at least the next year.  Please take it into consideration. Here is my site:  www.carstenKnoche.com  In addition, I contributed many of my pictures to QUAKEBOOK.org, and if you have never heard this organization, PLEASE check them out as well.  All of Quakebook's revenue will also go towards the Red Cross Japan.   www.quakebook.org/   Lastly, you can contribute directly to Red Cross Japan here:  www.jrc.or.jp/english/relief/l4/Vcms4_00002070.html  Thank you very much for facing this tragedy with us. With cooperation, strength, and perseverance, we can accomplish anything.  Take care, Carsten Knoche"

Day 13/365  .     I had to use this quote somewhere. It's from one of my favourite movies, and arguably one of the best Tarantino flicks around. Certainly a classic. I think the quote fits this SHEPHERD (hehe) perfectly. As almost everyone knows, these dogs will lay by your side in your darkest hour, they will lick your wounds seeping sadness and dry your eyes with their coat, and best of all look at you in the morning like you never faltered. Unlike children, they will think the world of you for their entire life. From the time they enter this world as tiny cashmere balls of energy until the day that they lay their gray beard upon your lap and let out one final cathartic sigh, they will idolize you and literally live to serve you. It's pretty obvious why they're referred to as man's best friend but you don't truly understand that concept until it's too late and you've watched a lifecycle begin and come to a tragic end all in the span of your childhood. But like any experience, you do not truly understand it until you have overcome the situation. Sadness and grieving as a child is invaluable as there will surely be a time later in life where one will be forced to reconcile with death and loss. Nothing lives forever and furthermore to speak very generally, to have a set of preconceived notions or ideas is a very dangerous thing. Yes, it may saturate our lives with confidence and reality, but it also inhibits our creative abilities as well as creates a barrier of which must be crossed in order to experience change or growth. Growth is change and vice versa. Once one achieves the realization that change is unavoidable and alteration of our perceived reality is inevitable, we can begin to be at peace. The most difficult part though is being able to accept that limitations most likely do not exist. Speaking small scale, of course they exist- for example the world is only so large, well yes technically the earth has a specific volume but to speak of the world as everything, the only thing we know for sure is that we do not know and that there is an observable universe. This concept shattered my perception upon researching how possibly infinite space is. To think that while we sit in our house of a set size there is an encasing around us that potentially continues forever is unsettling. But when you really look at it, our body is just a shell for our brain. Our brain is a shell for every emotion, thought, perception, speculation and concept that we deem as tangible, in a figurative sense. AND even further, those thoughts, feelings and perceptions are a shell for our subconscious that almost seamlessly dictates the manner in which each of these things come to light within an individual. So does that mean that the innermost 'object' is actually in control of every larger 'object' for without that nucleus, so to speak, there is nothing. It is all very concerning, and these topics of unprofessional, angst ridden philosophy that I find myself pondering and growing frustrated with, perhaps even mildly insane at times since I repeatedly put myself in a paradoxal state of mind that leads me into circles with no plausible answer in sight, are what we will come to understand as society as a greater mass in the future, I think. You could always say that the answer to my madness is accepting and consciously stating that I know nothing. Now that is only true in context, and in terms of perspective of course, but does that mean that since I have come to a conclusion that there is in fact a conclusion, and if there is a conclusion then I am not, in fact, insane. But for an individual to claim their own sanity, is often to be insane. And with that concept in mind, I am sent back into a spiralling frenzy of thought discrediting my theories but also proving the theory that we, compared to our perceived infinity, know nothing and that we are responsible for influencing anything we choose, or desire to influence with infinite possibility...   .     Anyway, I took this shot in Niagara as well yesterday after touring a winery and met this friendly dog at a garden centre run by a quaint pair of seniors who undoubtedly have channeled their inner cozy-ness to create a store which creates the feeling of just that. One would feel at home just by stepping foot indoors. From the cats and dogs to the clich coasters displaying messages of encouragement, it was home for these two. "

The 200000 inhabitants of the southern tribes are considered behind the times  by Addis. They are moved by force, oppressed, put in jail, and some are even killed. 50 deaths occurred in Maji, 11 in Dima, 5 in Koka the last few weeks, including women and children.  Surma or Suri (as they call themselves) are sedentary pastoral people living in south west of Ethiopia, on the western bank of the Omo river. These breeders tribal groups have a cattle-centred culture. They breed their cattle, mostly cows, on their traditional lands, located in the Omo Valley. The economy of the Suri is based on breeding and agriculture. They grow cabbage, beans, yams, tobacco and coffee. Cows are tremendously important in Suri culture. They do not see cattle simply as a material asset but as a life-sustaining and meaningful companion. Suri even sing songs for them and make fires to warm them. These cows are not bred for their meat and are usually not killed unless they are needed for ceremonial purposes. The Surmas very rarely eat the meat of their cows, they actually breed them for their milk and their blood, which they both drink. Cows also have a social and symbolic meaning in Suris society. Suri men are judged on how much cattle they own. In desperate times, Suri men can risk their lives to steal cattle from other tribes.The average male in the Suri tribe owns from 30 to 40 cows. Every young male is named after their cattle, which they have to look after since the age of 8. Men are not allowed to marry until they own 60 cows. Cows are given to the brides family after the wedding ceremony.  This central role of the cow in their way of life accounts for the fierce independance they want to preserve and explains their warlike culture. Indeed, its quite common to see men and even women carrying weapons which are part of the daily life. Their remote homeland has always been a place of traditional rivalries with the neighbouring tribes such as the Bume (Nyangatom) or the Toposa. who regurlarly team up to raid the Suris cattle. These fights, and even sometimes battles, have become quite bloody since automatic firearms like AK-47 have become available from the parties in the Sudanese Civil War. This conflict has pushed neighboring tribes into Suris land and is a constant competition to keep and protect their territory and their cattle. Gun battles are more common during the dry season, because around that time the Suri move their cattle down south to find new ground. The 40 to 1,000 inhabitants villages of the Surmas, are led by a ritual chief known as the Komoru, dressed in colourful robes and wearing a crown of baboon fur. Village life is largely communal, sharing the produce of the cattle (milk and blood). Decisions of the village are taken by the men in an assembly. These debates are led by the Komoru, who are merely the most respected elder in a village even if they can be removed. Although their traditional remoteness and autarky is threathened, only few Surma are familiar with Amharic, the official language of Ethiopia, and their literacy level is very low.

Their feathers are too bright, their songs too sweet and wild. So you let them go, or when you open the cage to feed them they somehow fly out past you. And the part of you that knows it was wrong to imprison them in the first place rejoices, but still, the place where you live is that much more drab and empty for their departure.  - Stephen King.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ /in other news:  i remember taking a photo of a dead bird years ago in Galveston.  i took the photo because as a child, i often wondered where birds went to die.    animal death is a weird thing for me.  there is a strange sense of peaceful calm mixed with an overwhelming sense of time speeding up beyond our control.   there is a relief that they are long gone from this rough, uncaring world - and a sadness that their presence will no longer evoke joy or wonder from another living creature. it's hard to explain. i guess it just translates down to: life goes on.   within the past week, i've managed to see more dead animals on the road than i ever  have in my entire life.  these include: 3 grackles, 2 herons, 1 deer, 3 squirrels, 1 cat, 1 snake, 1 turtle...and this little guy above.  unfortunately, seeing dead birds on the ground has become more and more commonplace 'round these parts.

Taking pictures just has not been the most important thing for me at this point, but nevertheless I will continue squeezing the shutter whenever I can.  Hopefully, we will all be able to see dramatic transformation of these areas back into their original beauty, but it is clearly a long road ahead.    If you live in the area and wish to help, please contact me and I will send you a list of volunteer centers throughout Miyagi as well as a list of important equipment to bring with you.  If you do decide to volunteer, please go with an organized group and bring the necessary equipment.  I don't mean to frighten anyone, but I was notified again today that there still are dangerous areas.  Don't go alone, please.    Here is a video that I took of the area the same day I took these pictures:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=CazswZd454o  The area that these pictures were taken, was utterly obliterated by the tsunami.  After a few hours of hauling items back and forth between my friends' destroyed home, I started to get a headache and feel sick from the fumes.  In my last post, I also mentioned that I had heard of people setting off explosions and starting fires from trying to light their cigarettes.    We worked amidst pure devastation for about 5 Hours, however we were only able to salvage a handful of their things. Sometimes it was hard to know what was theirs, since the tsunami had swept a whole city worth of belongings through the first floor of their home.  Surprisingly, the four-year-old house was in pretty good shape despite the fact that it was blown back off of its foundation about 200 feet and sat about 10-15 degrees off of level (in the video I said 60 feet, but I meant to say 60 meters.  The distance and angle is still a total guess, but you can judge for yourself in the pictures/video).  The structure of house was in such good condition, that we were able to walk up to the second floor and salvage most of the dry, smaller items.  Their daughter was just given a brand new bed and desk-set as an elementary graduation present, but we unfortunately could not take it out.     The reason we needed to go and salvage what we could as quickly as possible was because the house, although it did not look like it, was sitting in the middle of a road.  The city and self defense force had given them  only a few more days to clear out before they would have to bulldoze it down.    I asked the family if they had tsunami insurance, but apparently there is no tsunami insurance.  They will receive a small amount of money from the government, but it will not even come close to covering the damage they sustained.    The most dumbfounding part of that day for me was not surreal experience of walking through the total destruction of an entire town, but rather the laughing and smiling that came from a family who just lost everything- everything except each other.  Items and worldly possessions are of little value against the people we hold dear.  I tried to reciprocate the smiles, laughter, and healthy conversation (especially in light of the children), but it wasn't easy fighting off the grim emotions lurking below the surface.    This last weekend, I was able to volunteer for a short time in Downtown Ishinomaki and also take a few more pictures/video  The downtown area seems to be getting a lot more attention, and about half of the roads seem traversable.  Downtown also felt incredibly safe during the day time due to the dozens of police and military (both Japanese and US) walking the streets and distributing food and water at the camps.  I will post those pictures later this week.  I know my website is in shambles right now (I just have not had time), but I'm hoping to have it looking nicer as soon as possible.  I've never really sold anything from my website, but I'm going to donate all of the money I earn from ANY of the pictures I sell (not just the quake photos) to Red Cross Japan for at least the next year.  Please take it into consideration. Here is my site:  www.carstenKnoche.com  In addition, I contributed many of my pictures to QUAKEBOOK.org, and if you have never heard this organization, PLEASE check them out as well.  All of Quakebook's revenue will also go towards the Red Cross Japan.   www.quakebook.org/   Lastly, you can contribute directly to Red Cross Japan here:  www.jrc.or.jp/english/relief/l4/Vcms4_00002070.html  Thank you very much for facing this tragedy with us. With cooperation, strength, and perseverance, we can accomplish anything.  Take care, Carsten Knoche"

""it seems to me that almost all our sadnesses are moments of tension, which we feel as paralysis because we no longer hear our astonished emotions living. because we are alone with the unfamiliar presence that has entered us; because everything we trust and are used to is for a moment taken away from us; because we stand in the midst of a transition where we cannot remain standing. that is why the sadness passes: the new presence inside us, the presence that has been added, has entered our heart, has gone into its innermost chamber and is no longer even there, - is already in our bloodstream. and we don't know what it was. we could easily be made to believe that nothing happened, and yet we have changed, as a house that a guest has entered changes. we can't say who has come, perhaps we will never know, but many signs indicate that the future enters us in this way in order to be transformed in us, long before it happens. and that is why it is so important to be solitary and attentive when one is sad: because the seemingly uneventful and motionless moment when our future steps into us is so much closer to life than that other loud and accidental point of time when it happens to us as if from outside. the quieter we are, the more patient and open we are in our sadnesses, the more deeply and serenely the new presence can enter us, and the more we can make it our own, the more it becomes our fate.""  ~ rainer maria rilke"

Where is the world to save us from the fire and sadness? Where is the world to save the hunger strikers?"" -- Adnan Latif, Yemeni Guantanamo prisoner held for ten years without ever having been charged with a crime and cleared for release on four separate occasions, found dead in his cell on September 8, 2012.   Right now, the men detained at the U.S. prison in Guantnamo are engaged in a large-scale hunger strike, which began in early February. Two weeks ago guards used excessive force and rubber bullets on prisoners who resisted being forcibly moved from communal to individual cells. This was done in an attempt to stop the hunger strike. The hunger  strike has now escalated and, as of April 30, lawyers for the prisoners  say over 100 are now on a hunger strike, with about one-fifth of the  prisoners  being  force fed.   The vast majority of the 166 men have been held for more than 11 years without any charge or fair trial, with no end to their detention in sight. The Obama administration must take immediate measures to address the causes of the hunger strike and fulfill its promise to close Guantnamo  without further delay. And we demand an end to the illegal policy of  indefinite detention.
