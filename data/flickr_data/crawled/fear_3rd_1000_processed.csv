British Quad (30"" X 40""). www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSusc0RZegk&feature=share&amp... Trailer The Brides were played by: Andree Melly as Ginaand Marie Devereux as the Village Girl. Baroness Meinster"" was played by Martita Hunt and Marianne Danielle was Yvonne Monlaur. Greta was played by Freda Jackson : Best Scene: When the innkeepers (Greta was played by Freda Jackson) daughter (Marie Devereux) falls prey to the Baron and is buried, she is interred in the churchyard. Van Helsing goes one night to investigate her grave, and finds Greta Freda Jackson laying with her ear to the mound, muttering into the freshly turned earth. Yes my dear, I know its dark. No, I cant help. Youve got to push. The scene has a really macabre intensity, and the unmistakable allusions to childbirth play out perfectly, with Freda, already established as having nursed the young Baron from infancy, playing the part of an encouraging midwife as the innkeepers daughters pale hand slowly breaks through the ground and she is born as a vampire, emerging at last from her coffin, pale and fanged. Best Dialogue/Line:  Baroness: Who is it that is not afraid? Van Helsing: Only God has no fear. Baroness: Why have you come here? Van Helsing: To find your son. Baroness Meinster: Then you know who I am? Van Helsing: I know who you were  Director Terence Fisher's follow-up to the hit Horror of Dracula was one of only a few Hammer vampire films to not feature Christopher Lee in the lead role. David Peel was instead cast as Baron Meinster, with Peter Cushing returning as Dr. Van Helsing to combat the bloodsucking fiend.  The Brides of Dracula is the first sequel to 'The Horror of Dracula'. This film does not have Christopher Lee, or Dracula for that matter, but is among the most lush of the Hammer films. Release Date: 1960 Directed By: Terence Fisher Written By: Jimmy Sangster, Peter Bryan, and Edward Percy Peter Cushing as Doctor Van Helsing Martina Hunt as Baroness Meinster Yvonne Mauler as Marianne Danielle Freda Jackson as Greta:  David Peel as Baron Meinster The young and beautiful French schoolteacher Marianne (Yvonne Mauler) is abandoned by her coach driver in an isolated village. When she arrives at an inn seeking shelter, she ignores the warnings of others and goes with Baroness Meinster (Martina Hunt) to stay with her at her castle. There she meets the Baroness handsome son, Baron Meinster (David Peel), who has his leg chained to a wall. He tells her that his mother has taken his right to the lands and imprisoned him. She steals the keys and sets him free, and his mother and their servant Greta (Freda Jackon) become terribly upset. The Baroness is bitten and killed by her evil son, who we learn is a vampire. When Greta shows the body to Marianne she runs away and is found by Van Helsing (Peter Cushing). The Baron, now free, turns his mother into a vampire, as well as, a little later, a pretty girl from the village. Meanwhile, Greta has become his human servant. He sets his eyes on making Marianne his as well, and only Van Helsing can stop his reign of evil. This is the first of Hammers sequels to their classic, influential, and hugely successful The Horror of Dracula. Christopher Lee does not return and there is no Dracula, nor is there any mention of him in the movie, aside from the narration at the beginning which tells that he has many followers. Van Helsing, though, does return making him the most direct link to the aforementioned film. Fisher finely directs The Brides of Dracula, and it ranks as one of the most lush and sumptuous of all of the Hammer films from the period. The sets are beautiful, as are the costumes worn by the cast. The film is always stunning to look at, a truly lavish production in every sense of the word, despite the surely low budget. There are some very exciting and memorable moments in The Brides of Dracula, and even before Cushing ever sets into a single frame, there is already a wonderful set-up. One such moment is when the Baroness talks about her son introducing him for the very first time. Its a great bit of dialogue, and of acting from Hunt, and it really sets up the tone, as well as the characters and story. Another potent, and ultimately creepy, scene comes when the pretty vamp is resurrected while Greta cheers her on. Both the first confrontation between the Baron and Van Helsing and the climax are very thrilling. In fact, the later is one of the finest of any and all of Hammers movies. And, the ending is simply awesome and features one of the coolest ways to dispose of a vampire, ever! Hunt isnt the only one who gives a great performance, as the whole cast is just excellent. Cushing is his always amazing self, proving yet again that he is the definitive Van Helsing. He remains heroic and classy throughout the movie. Peel makes for a great villain - So good, that any disappointment over Lee not appearing in The Brides of Dracula fade quickly. There are few greater complements that can be paid to a horror star than that. Peels Baron is sly, seductive, classy, and outright evil. Mauler makes for a likeable and beautiful heroine in the movie, and in keeping with the Hammer tradition both of the vampire brides to the Baron are very sexy and attractive as well. The wonderful acting in this film is strengthened by great dialogue, and the script is perhaps the best in all of vampire movie history. This is an amazing film that has rightfully taken its place as one of Hammers very best films, and well lives up to its legacy. No list of the best of Hammers work is complete without including The Brides of Dracula, and no true fan of bloodsucker cinema should miss it. "

I find myself in the Taza area, just south of Kirkuk, on the road to Baghdad. According to them, very few journalists come here. Some even said that I was the only was they saw. Nonetheless, it is a key strategic location. It is very dangerous there since Kirkuk is divided: Kurds in the north, ISIS in the south. All along the front lines you can see different units roaming about little traditional houses. Some are kept by old Kurdish vets from the 1980s wars. Many vets have returned to war, despite being well past middle-aged and having children and grandchildren. Some even behind comfortable lives in Europe to come back, like a Swiss colonel I met. For them, it is their duty to fight for their region. Despite being autonomous and having a large secessionist movement, Kurdistan is not recognized as a state distinct from Iraq. Some terrorists come along and now the whole world calls them the Islamic State, complains one peshmerga, For decades we have been trying to make the state of Kurdistan and weve gotten nothing! They have very few weapons, most of them are pre-Cold War AK47s. Some even date back to 1960. They still work, but the Kurdish forces ask for more efficient guns since ISIS has the latest weapons taken (or given) from the Iraqi army who in turn was supplied by coalition forces. Many vets have only one working eye. The other was lost in previous wars. Once night falls, it becomes very difficult to monitor the 1000km long border. They dont even have night vision equipment. Last week it rained for 5 days, and it was impossible to see or hear anything. Some ISIS guys tried to gain territory, but the Kurds successfully fought them off. Their 4 wheel drives were stuck in the mud while ISISs brand new hummers were able to move about without issue. From the front line you can see ISIS flags. Since they told me to pack light, I didnt bring a zoom lens. Sorry! You can see the smoke from their kitchen and even see men running from house to house. ISIS is only 500 meters from the Kurdish position but nobody seems afraid. Peshmerga know that death is part of their fate, and even if they look like an army from another century, they will defend themselves and their country to the very end. For them, it is the highest honor to die for Kurdistan. They protect the Baghdad road, but a few weeks ago lost it. After heavy fighting, they regained it, killing 3 Chechen ISIS fighters in the process. Since peshmerga dont have armored cars, it is very dangerous for them to go around safely. The car I took to go on the front lines was very slow and made in the 80s. If we were chased by ISIS cars, we wouldnt have stood a chance. In one day, all the materiel I saw included AK47s, a tank, an RPG, and a few gun old machines. Even if the pehsmergas say that this equipment works well, they are disappointed not to receive new ones, as Europe and USA promised. The day after my visit, France made lot of bombings in the area, as ISIS was too close. Peshmergas take a lot of pictures, not only for souvenirs, but also to fight ISIS on the new front: social media. They fear the roads they do not know well as ISIS pays the local farmers to put mines. Even in times of war, peshmergas are among the most welcoming people in the world. They regularly offer food and drinks. When it was time for me to go back to the safety of Erbil, circumstances changed. The north road was closed because of an ISIS attack. The only way out was to send me through the south road that crossed Kirkuk. Lets just say that safety there was not ideal. I had to hide my camera, and we crossed Kirkuk with an escort of armed peshmergas and a civilian car. The soldiers were all nervous since Kirkuk is very dangerous, especially at the check points. As soon as a car was driving next to ours for too long, they were shouting at the driver to go away. If a man was crossing the road too slowly, they threatened to hit him. These methods, employed by ISIS suicide bombers, have claimed the lives of hundred in Kirkuk. Once on the Kurdish side, they found a Kurdish taxi driver to bring me safely back to Erbil.

Religious extremism leading to terrorist activities is one such area that needs to be reviewed. While many South Asian countries are deeply embroiled in the fight against terrorism, Bangladesh had generally been free from terrorist attacks since 2005. As we tended to relax, two incidents in 2012 brought our focus back to the terrorism issue. The first was the burning and looting of the houses and temples of the Buddhist communities in Coxs Bazar area on 29-30 September. The second was the arrest on 17 October of a young Bangladeshi man caught while planning to bomb the Federal Reserve Building in New York, USA. As the year was coming to a close, the violence unleashed across the country by the Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), a right-wing Islamist party, sent us a clear signal of the growing strength of Islamist politics. These are happening at a time when an avowed secular party, the Awami League (AL), is in power. AL won the 2008 election with a commitment to amend the constitution to restore its secular character. It also promised stern action against all forms of religious extremism and terrorism. Four years down the line, much of those promises remain unfulfilled. Constitutional reform was half-done; Islam remained a state religion. Religious parties are more organised today than ever before. Their student fronts are active in most educational institutions. While Islamists are active on political fronts, more radical amongst them are organising themselves for terrorist activities as and when opportunities appear. Rise of Islamic extremism in Bangladesh On 16 December 1971, we hoped that Bangladesh would emerge as a modern democratic state. The spirit of the nation was epitomised in the Constitution (1972) that adopted secularism as a state principle and prohibited the political use of religion. The Constitution barred the state from declaring any religion as state religion. However, it all changed after the killing of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and many top-ranking political leaders in 1975. Those who seized power at the time found the Islamists as their political ally and started islamising the society and the state. Islamist political parties, such as JI, started building their party structures. The power elites established thousands of madrassas that produced religiously indoctrinated youths who would be the front-line activists of the Islamist parties. Poor, jobless students from the madrassas became easy target of the recruiters of militant Islamist organisations. By late 1990s we had militant organisations such as Jamiatul Mujahedin Bangladesh (JMB) and Harkatul Jihad Al-Islami (HUJI) that took roots in Bangladesh. Starting from 1999 to 2005, the militants bombed temples, churches, political rallies, cultural functions, cinema halls etc. The government and the opposition kept on blaming each other for those attacks. Even when grenades attack was made on the AL rally in Dhaka on 22 August 2004 killing 22 people and injuring the AL Chief Sheikh Hasina, the government blamed it on the opposition. The series bombing on 17 August 2005 finally compelled the government to come out of the denial mode and stand up to the terrorist threat. In 2006-07, we saw a series of arrests, prosecution and handing down of sentences, including death sentences, on some of the terror leaders. Since then there has been no major terror attack in Bangladesh, but that the terrorists are active is evident from the frequent arrests of activists and seizure of large cache of arms and explosives from their hideouts. Bulk of the Islamic militants arrested so far had come from poor rural communities. Many were from the Quomi Madrassa background. However, recent years saw a new breed of extremists called the Hizb-ut-Tahrir (HuT). HuT members are drawn from children of urban, upper income parentage, educated in the mainstream or English medium schools and colleges. HuT is targeting the cream of our youth, the nations future, and therefore, poses a clear danger. It is feared that HuT has penetrated among schools and universities, professionals  engineers, doctors, government officials and even among the security apparatus. Although the party was banned in 2009, its clandestine activities continue in the country. On the political front, JI continued to grow in strength in Bangladesh. The party is small in size, but highly disciplined, well-organised and has a well-defined hierarchy. Jamaats aim is to establish a pure Islamic state based on Sharia. The party had opposed the Liberation War of Bangladesh in 1971 and actively collaborated in the genocide. Some of the top leaderships are now facing war-crime trial. The party, therefore, is on a back foot now, but given the fact that a new election is around the corner, its rank and file might align with the major opposition party to make a bid for power. JIs student wing, Islami Chattra Shibir (Islamic Students Front), is now a potent student organisation, from schools to universities. The other Islamist party of importance is Islami Oikyo Jote (Islamic Unity Front), a collection of small Islamic parties. Like JI, IOJ also wants to establish an Islamic state in Bangladesh, but there are differences in outlook. IOJ members are exclusively from Quomi madrassa background and more traditional. IOJ has been in the forefront, along with JI, in the movement to declare Ahmedia community as non-Muslims. Present governments attempt to register Quomi Madrassas and reform their curriculum was thwarted by IOJs agitation. None of the Islamist political parties gave open support to the militant activities, however, many of the JMB and HUJI activists had previously been members of Islamist political parties. The Islamist parties have multifarious social, economic and financial investments. Some of the largest banks, insurance, hospitals, diagnostic centres, schools, universities, coaching centres, and travel agencies are operated undercover by the Islamist parties. The Islamist parties have been gaining in strength in Bangladesh at the expense of the two major political parties  BNP and AL. Both parties at one time or other have been courting these parties in order to gain short term advantage over the other. Countering the extremists Bangladesh government has taken a number steps to check extremism and militancy. Notable among those are: Anti-Terrorism Act 2009 and Money Laundering Prevention Act 2009 as amended in 2011. The two acts provide for deterrent punishment to offenders in case they engage in acts of terror or launder money to support terrorism. Based on a series of dialogues, workshops and seminars, participated by academics, researchers, politicians, parliamentarians, civil and military officials, a national strategy to combat terrorism in the country has been proposed.Bangladesh has banned a total of six terrorist organizations, including JMB, HUJI and HuT. A number of Islamic NGOs have been banned who had terror links, including Revival of Islamic Heritage Society (Kuwait), Rabita Al Alam Al Islami (Saudi Arabia), and International Islamic relief Organization (Saudi Arabia), Muslim Aid (UK). More than 1,300 militants were arrested; most of them belonging to JMB, HUJI-B or HuT. 29 terrorist kingpins have been sentenced to death and many more sentenced to long imprisonment or are awaiting trial.While our police action has been commendable, we did not do enough on the social front. We need to address urgently the problem of poverty, ignorance, and backwardness. Democratisation of the society is an insurance against extremist ideology. We need to improve governance and provide access to justice for the poor and downtrodden. We need to impart modern education to our youth that prepare them to face the challenges of a fast changing world. A thorough overhaul of madrassa education in our country is long overdue. We need an education system that produce people with high ethical and technical standards, a system that encourages freethinking rather than rote learning. Emergence of HuT points out a lack of pride and a sense of disillusionment among the children of affluent class. This is because English medium schools, where most of the rich parents send their children, follow a curriculum that has no relevance to our culture, history or traditions. Therefore, English medium school syllabus too needs a thorough review.Government must legislate not to allow use of religion to gain political mileage. We need to check creeping Sudiaization of Islam. Along with the money from the ME donors, comes the ideological package of Wahhabi Islam which is alien to South Asia. One of the prices we pay for the remittance from our labour force in the ME is the influx of Saudi brand of Islam. How do we de-radicalise these migrant workers is a big challenge for us. Meanwhile, hundreds of extremists who are arrested or under trial must be segregated from other prisoners. At present, these extremists are finding a captive audience 24 hours at their disposal, busy recruiting new ones from among the prisoners. We need to isolate the extremists and start a de-radicalisation program so that when they return to the society they become useful citizen.Our effort to counter religious extremism must be supplemented by regional and global effort. We need to have close cooperation and coordination between the governments of the region. Border monitoring, passport control, anti-money laundering measures, exchange of information on the movement of suspects, arrest and deportation of fugitives are some of the areas where regional countries could cooperate. Checking of arms smuggling across the porous border is another area where regional cooperation is the answer. In short, a total, comprehensive strategy has to be adopted for fighting religious extremism. If Bangladesh is to emerge as a modern, democratic state, the menace of extremism must be eliminated.  "
