San Marcos El enorme complejo conventual de San Marcos de Len, en la salidanatural de la ciudad camino de Compostela, fue la sede principal de laOrden de caballera de Santiago para el Reino de Len y constituye elmejor ejemplo del arte del Renacimiento en la provincia.  Pese a ese estilo predominante, su edificacin se remonta a la EdadMedia (de la que nada conservamos), culmin en el siglo XVIII imitandoel estilo renacentista, y fue muy alterada por la edificacin delParador nacional en la dcada de 1960.  Su vasta fachada est tapizada de arquitecturas retricas y relievesclasicistas, y cuenta con detalles escultricos de primera magnitud,del cincel de Juni, entre otros. Se ejecut tambin en los dos momentosdistintos de la construccin: la parte oriental pertenece a la primeramitad del XVI, mientras que el lado del ro se realiz ya a primerosdel XVIII, como revela la iconografa de los monarcas y maestres.  La iglesia, acreditada representante del ""estilo Reyes Catlicos""-ltimo gtico hispano- en el lateral de la fachada plateresca, es unesbelto cajn con capillas entre contrafuertes. En su interior, elclaustro renacentista, con resabios de estructura tardogtica, organizaun vasto conjunto del que pueden visitarse tres salas. Dos de stasforman el espacio ms atractivo y genuino del edificio, la antiguasacrista, autntica exhibicin de ornato escultrico, obra maestra deJuan de Badajoz ""el joven"", su artfice en 1549, como puede leerse ensu autorretrato sobre la entrada de la estancia.  Ambas salas se dedican hoy da a ofrecer al visitante un perfil sobrela historia e interpretacin de este monumento -De lo que fue SanMarcos-, as como una seleccin de los bienes que posey en su da -Delo que tuvo San Marcos-, entre los que se cuentan dos series pictricasde tipo iconogrfico: la de retratos de Caballeros de la Orden deSantiago y la de escenas del Gnesis.  Finalmente, una tercera estancia, llamada sala del claustro se dedicaa los distintos usos del edificio tras la desamortizacin, ya en manosdel Estado. Fue entonces cuando empez la relacin de San Marcos con elMuseo de Len, pues esta fue su sede desde su apertura pblica en 1869hasta la inauguracin de su nueva sede (en el edificio Pallars) en 2007. Desde entonces sus antiguas salas son anexo monumental del Museo.  San Marcos de Len, uno de los hitos monumentales imprescindibles detoda visita a la ciudad, se halla entre los ms completos y soberbiosconjuntos de la edilicia del Renacimiento hispano y supone unareferencia fundamental para la historia y el arte de estas tierras.  A determinadas horas y en grupos guiados tambin puede visitarse laSillera del coro, obra maestra de Guillermo Doncel, Juan de Juni yJuan de Angers, ejecutada entre 1537 y 1543 en nogal sin policromar yuna de las mejores piezas en su gnero y poca de nuestro pas."

It's just me feeling sorry for myself. I shouldn't. 365 Days  7 Days, 23 Hours, 10 Minutes until I'm done with my Step 1 Board Exam.  See the USMLE Study Series  ***  I took this picture this morning after studying a bit. I was fine, it was all good. The title was going to be Please, no more, I cant take it. Then I took another practice test. I got a 52%. I failed. Like really, really failed. I freaked out. I had a nervous breakdown so to say. Not good. To put this score into perspective, my goal is an 80. Ive been told you have to have at least a 75 to get a residency in any good medical field. Since June 1 my practice test scores have averaged 67, which is OK. But not 80. Youd think my scores would be getting BETTER the more I studied, no? Yeah, well, I just cant memorize that much shit. The reason I titled the photo as I did was because I technically was supposed to be taking my exam today. I recently postponed it, thankfully. Imagine if I got a 52% on the actual exam! Thatd be like $100,000 I just wasted right there. Whoo. That would be bad. OK, anyways, so there I was, freaking out, when Ryan calls me. He passed his 5th actuarial exam. He is more than half way to being a full FCAS super cool awesome actuary. I am so proud of him. He is so smart. I love him so much. But what do I do? I cry into the phone and take away all his glory. Im such a jerk. I had to leave my house, I had to get away. Since I had errands to do I figured Id get them done. First I drove to school to get my PPD (they have to check us for TB every year, since were always around the infecteds). The student health center closed 1 minute before I got there. Of course. So I go across the street to the Family Medicine clinic to get a PPD. There I have to wait forever even though all they have to do is stab me with a needle filled with the protein. I could do it myself. Anyways after that I go up the administrative office to pick up my grades from that comprehensive exam and the OSCE (clinical exam) that I took in May. I really shouldnt have. I was really not in the right mindset to find out that I am below average. Yeah, who wouldve thought Miss 98th percentile is below average? Well, I scored below average on Taking a History, Performing a Physical Exam, General Impression Overall, on the OSCE and below average on the Written portion and the Integrated Cases portion. I got way above average on the Practical portion, but that was only 7% of the exam. It just proves Im destined to be a pathologist. Anyways as I cried the entire walk back to my car, I remembered I had to get a prescription filled. I was at the pharmacy at Albertsons for a good 30 minutes and I didnt even get what I went for! Damn insurance companies. So far this day is going so well, no? Next I figure I better get some coffee. Caffeine always makes me feel better. I get to Starbucks and order and then I wait. Then I wait some more. And then I wait some more. Arrrrrgh!! They forgot. At this point in time my car is filled with used tear-filled tissues, my mind is filled with hatred of myself, and my home is filled with facts I dont know, and now I cant have coffee!? Could I be any more depressed? . . Turns out I cant, actually! The lady got me my coffee AND I got a voucher for a free Starbucks coffee, any size any time. Sweet. Then Janis Joplin came on the radio. Then Ryan called me and told me he wants to go out to dinner with me to celebrate/cheer me up. Oh, and then I got invited to join a Flickr group Students On The Brink Of Insanity by this awesome student! Im all better. :-D . . . . . for now."

Carrying placards which portrayed President Basescu as a mafioso, and the country's un-reconstructed communist-era security service as resembling the SS, the protesters said they felt like ""second-hand Europeans"", accusing their government of widespread corruption and arrogance.  The second poorest country in the European Union with a per capita income less than half the EU average - and struggling to cope with the continuing shockwaves of the Europe-wide recession - Romanians have recently seen swingeing cuts made to public health and welfare programs, wages slashed by 25% and sales tax increased by Basescu's close political ally, Prime Minister Emil Boc, triggering a wave of mass demonstrations in this usually subdued country over the past week, with the threat of general strikes called by trade unions and workers laid off by the defence sector, who want Basescu to resign.  Last Thursday - 19.01.2012 - saw over 7,000 leftist opposition USL alliance and anti-austerity protesters clashing with police in Bucharest who fired tear gas against demonstrators, some of whom threw bricks and rubbish bins in retaliation, and on Saturday, several hundred people assembled for a ninth successive day in Bucharest's University Square, known as 'Kilometre Zero of Democracy' for its role in the 1989 anti-communist revolution.

These photos are depicting Borderline Personality Disorder.  The DSM-IV-TR criteria for BPD are:     1. Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment.     2. A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation.    3. Identity disturbance: markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self.    4. Impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging    5. Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, threats or self-injuring behavior such as cutting    6. Affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood    7. Chronic feelings of emptiness, worthlessness.    8. Inappropriate anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g., frequent displays of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights).    9. Transient, stress-related paranoid ideation, delusions or severe dissociative symptoms  These photos are heavily focused on the emotional sensitivity, instability and insecurity and the frantic attempts to avoid abandonment paired with patterns of threatened or performed self-harming behaviors.  These photos are a deliberate exaggeration of these symptoms and are not meant to stigmatize individuals with BPD.  Individuals with BPD tend to form very intense and unstable relationships with others.  In these photos, my character, in the midst of a very dramatic emotional episode involving her significant other, is blocking the door threatening to harm or deface herself (by cutting off a chunk of her hair) in a frantic attempt to keep him from leaving her.  A variety of emotions are portrayed in this set, indicating fear, desperation, insecurity, self-hatred, and intense and extreme emotions towards the other person.  Others indicate more of an overt, deliberately manipulative motive.  For more information about BPD, go to:  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder#DSM...  Once I have completed a set of self-portraits for each personality disorder, only one of these will be chosen for the final set when I can more easily determine which photos fit the best in relation to the others.

About 200 people attended the event in St Enoch Square, which is part of the larger 'Bring Back Our Girls' campaign.  Security forces are still searching for the students, who were abducted by Boko Haram Islamist militants on 14 April.  The group condemns those who have been educated in the ""Western"" system, and opposes the education of women.  The Boko Haram insurgency has left thousands dead since 2009.  The missing girls, from the town of Chibok in north eastern Nigeria, are in their final year of school, and most of them are aged 16 to 18.  They are thought to be held in the Sambisa forest, a remote and inaccessible area of country.   The protest was part of the 'Bring Back Our Girls' campaign  Josephine Adekola, a representative of the Nigerian community in Glasgow, said: ""Every Nigerian across the world, wherever they are, feels frustration and anger about this.  ""There's real concern and anxiety about Boko Haram and we want our government to stand up and do something about it.  ""We're sending a message to Nigerians that people here are concerned and we want the mothers who are going through this grief to understand that we feel their pain.  ""We want answers from the Nigerian government and we want our girls back.""  Event organiser Megan Mitchell told BBC Scotland: ""We want to raise awareness on this issue and we won't be silent. We're a month down the line from these girls going missing and there's been inaction from governments, charities, the media and international community.  ""We're calling on people to write to their MSPs, their MPs, local government and charities and make their voices heard.  ""If ordinary people are taking to the streets and saying this is an important issue, governments and international organisations will listen."" "

The state-owned Railway Authorities told the drivers representatives that their demands to raise the incentives from 11pt to 25pt per kilometer, were rejected.  Following the protest, and the threat to block the trains, the chief of police in station negotiated with the drivers, who only suspended their assembly around 1:40pm, awaiting the results of another meeting promised by the govt on 24 November.

anger,http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8250/8606235336_529363abd9_z.jpg,1,4,"Reign of Terror: Brutality of BNP JAMAT It was 5.23 pm on 21st august 2004 when Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina was wrapping up a rally protesting Sylhet blasts. A wave of grenade attacks on her left at least 16 people killed and left around 200 persons critically injured including top Awami League leaders Abdur Razzak, Amir Hossain Amu, Suranjit Sengupta, Ivy Rahman and Kazi Zafarullah. The party secretary on Women affairs Ivy Rahman died in the Hospital later in the day. The unknown assailants fired seven bullets at the bulletproof SUV that Hasina boarded immediately after the blast. The unusually poor deployment of police at the rally and the absence of forces on nearby building rooftops are a remarkable deviation from the usual practice. Motaher Hossain, general secretary of AL Krishak League said some people on the roof of Ramna hotel and adjacent building were throwing bombs. At least 13 grenades exploded one after another, and also who were present on the spot told a white Microbus carried of some injured person who were among the assailant and were wounded by their own bomb. Blame game started at the very moment Hasina spoke out loud about governments conspiracy to kill the remaining member of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujiber Rahmans remaining family members, BNP leaders hold back and Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan commented that they have blamed the government out of emotion. But soon BNP leaders changed their tone and started to blame AL for attacking their own rally, they argued AL had done it to destabilize the country and discredit the government only to grab the power. Fiction and conspiracy theories were put forward by various columnists in the media. Pro Awami columnists blamed the fundamentalist forces and the right wing coalition government for this attack while pro BNP columnists blamed AL and pointed finger towards the countrys biggest neighbor India. However most columnists inclined towards Awami league and left parties and leaders and activists of these parties discovered a pattern in the bomb blasts. In most cases secular forces and those who believe in culture, tradition and democratic values had been the target. The same group was behind the attack on Hasinas rally. Those pro BNP columnists pick up the same incident and argued Hasina was not the target of those assailants, if she were their target then why none of those grenades fall on the truck and also wrote thousand pages about ALs possible motive behind this? Some suspected it as a plot by international Muslim extremist groups; some pointed towards the association of ISI (Inter Services Intelligence); while Jamaat leader Matiur Rahman Nizami believes it is the work of well known enemies of Islam who masterminded, through various covert organizations, to carry out such brutal murders. It became increasingly hard to dig out the truth from these fictions. With conspiracy theories you can use any piece of evidence to either prove or disprove your opinion and you can pick up any particular incident to strengthen your position. Truth has many faces but with conspiracy theory all you can achieve is a thousand shade of the truth and all these are equally probable and could be equally false. In this present regime we have finally a charge sheet that clearly indicates Awami Leagues position is correct in this issue, RAB and other government intelligence agency finally concluded that Islamic militants are behind this attack and also a small fraction of BNP activists patronized this attack. But is it the whole truth or only a facade? Lets look at the proceedings of the investigations. To investigate 21st August 2004 bomb blast then BNP government first employed metropolitan polices detective branch to investigate this incident, then this case was handed over to the criminal investigation department of Bangladesh Police. Five investigating officer under 3 officers in charge investigated this incident for over 4 years and they had submitted two charge sheet contradicting each other. What is the progress in this case? When ever you ask this question to a law enforcement officer, a certain reply will be that we are still investigating this matter. We had some lead but for the sake of this on going investigation we can not tell you anything. Even after submitting charge sheet against 22 person in June 11, 2008 and acquitting all other person found guilty (on the first charge sheet presented by the CID), still the investigation has not been closed. So far we have 2 persons who claimed that they had actively participated in this failed assassination. On 26th June, 2005 Joj Miah from Noakhali confessed to police that for 5000 taka he carried out this attack under the order of Subrata Bain, a top terrorist. Subrata Bain and his group had close ties with some notorious AL leaders and they fled to India after alliance government took over the state in October 2001. He confessed to a magistrate that he had never seen any grenade before but Subrata Bain, Joy, Molla Masud ordered him to participate in this assassination. ASP of Police [CID] Abdur Rashid was the investigation officer then. But the government were not satisfied with this finding so led by Munsi Atikur Rahman the investigation continued. The investigation found a paved path established by the coalition government. So far we have two investigation reports, one of them was by Justice Jaynul Abedin, chairman of the one man investigation committee formed by the government to investigate 21st august grenade attack on Awami leagues rally. Awami League has rejected this report claiming it lacks neutrality. And another one was submitted by the Supreme Court Bar Association. According to Moudud Ahmed, who was Law minister at that time, claimed that this inquiry committee is illegal. Jaynul Abedins investigation report: Justice Jaynul Abedin had submitted his 162 pages manuscript of coalition governments collective story on 2nd October 2004. He was the member and chairman of one man inquiry committee formed by the government to investigate the grenade attack on Awami League rally on 21st august. On the eve of this submission those authorities in concern had invited journalist to give some insight of the report. After scrutiny, critical and painstaking analysis, Jaynul Abedin did omit the possibility that coalition government and his ally, some extremist religious group and a part of Awami League was behind this heinous attack on Awami League activists. But he did claim with certainty that a foreign intelligence agency actively participated in this event. They trained those assailants and equipped them with necessary ammunitions. He described this event on that informal press conference, this incident is a naked attack on the independence and sovereignty of the country. Because Jaynul Abedin was a BNP activist in the past, Awami League questioned the neutrality of the investigation committee. Even though 123 people given their statement to this committee but that does not include Sheikh Hasina, who was the prime target of this massacre. Sheikh Hasina rejected the call for her statement. In that one and half hour informal briefing on the report prior to its submission Jaynul concluded the commission may not have received cooperation from all, which may have somewhat hindered the investigation, but the inquiry is in no way incomplete. Like any other investigation report submitted by any government formed investigation committee it also embraced the fate to remain unpublished till-to-date. The Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) inquiry committee report: On 22nd august, 2004, immediately after the grenade attack, The Supreme Court Bar Association formed an inquiry committee. Barrister Kamal Hossain was elected as the chairman of that committee and the other members of this committee were Rokonuddin Mahmud, Abdul Malek, Amir-ul-Islam, M Zahir and Muhammad Ayenuddin. While Hasina wrapped up the rally, at that very moment a grenade went off loud and it was followed by at least 10 such explosions. Awami League leaders formed a human shield to cover Hasina from the splinter, they were injured in this process and soon after they escorted Hasina to her bullet proof SUV and Hasina left for Sudha Sadan, while on the move that SUV was attacked by bullets. Witnesses on their statement confirmed the SCBA inquiry committee that they had not seen any member of the law enforcing agency in action there. After inspecting the place of occurrence on 27th august 2004 they went to Sudha Sadan, where Hasina assured the committee her full cooperation to find out the truth. Hasinas security personal and her driver gave their statement to this committee and this committee also inspected the SUV. Driver on his statement told the committee that he drove towards the east, then took a left turn and then he drove towards Sudha Sadan through zero point. But police officers deployed at the rally on 21st August on their statement said to inquiry committee, SUV carrying Sheikh Hasina away from that place drove westward, took a right turn, and then went to Sudha Sadan through zero point. On 16th, 17th, 18th September the committee watched the video tape recorded by ATN, Channel I and NTV. On ATN video tape they saw a young man purposefully looking towards the multi storied Dhaka City Bhaban. Apart from this, on Channel I and NTV footage some suspicious incidents were seen by the committee members. The inquiry committee sent two letters to Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, requesting her to extend cooperation for the inquiry and to direct the law enforcing agency to cooperate with them in interest of its work. A letter was sent from the inquiry committee to IGP Shahudul Huq on 29 August 2004 requesting him to direct the police authorities to inform the inquiry committee of the number of persons who were deployed for maintaining the law and order in the public meeting on 21st August 2004 with the descriptions of their duties and locations. After 3 weeks another letter was sent to him, requesting for his interview. The inquiry committee requested state minister of home affairs, but all of them turned down their request further more the law minister Moudud Ahmed on several occasion said that this inquiry committee had no legal basis and any report of any such illegal committee should not be recognized. But the government did inform the SCBA inquiry committee that they had done every thing that is possible for them and sent a copy of the statement made by the State Minister for Home Affairs in the Parliament. In that speech the State Minister mentioned that the police made all out efforts to identify the culprits immediately after the incident and within 24 hours a Judicial Inquiry Commission was constituted with a judge of the Supreme Court as the sole Member. He also mentioned that the Government also arranged for an international inquiry into the 21st August incident side by side with Bangladesh police investigation and in response to the Government invitation 3 (three) teams from Interpol visited Bangladesh and helped the inquiry. Besides this, the government had also taken cooperation of FBI of USA. The SCBA inquiry committee made repeated requests at the highest levels of the government for obtaining copies of reports of earlier bomb-blasts, the report of the judicial inquiry into the 21 August, 2004 constituted by the Government, and other documents and information, but such requests have till-to-date were turned down. The Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) inquiry committee concluded it was a pre-planned attack, carried out on the basis of a carefully prepared plan, targeting Sheikh Hasina and other leaders and persons attending the rally. The firing of the bullets and grenades on the vehicle by which she was leaving the place of occurrence, confirms that she was the target. The committee urged government to publish all reports of investigation within one month or else public may lead to believe attempt on Sheikh Hasinas life was to some extent was patronized by this government. The alleged HUJI rage against Awami League: Some columnists claimed in the media that the AL government, after assuming power in 1996 barred Islamic scholars from issuing fatwas through a High Court order. The government also came on strong against the right wing protesters and arrested hundreds across the country. This had angered HUJI. Mufti Abdul Hannan, the operative commander of the banned Harkatul Jihad-al-Islami revealed on 19th November 2006. I masterminded all grenade attacks across the country excepting the August 21, 2004 gruesome attack on the AL rally, and three people financed the outfit for carrying out the attacks Hannan gave another detailed statement on 1st November 2007: Kajol was given the responsibility to collect funds and grenades for the attack. They decided that 12 persons would carry out the attack and Kajol and Abu Jandal would select the commanders of the operation. It was decided that Kajol and Jandal brief the attackers about their positions and Jandal would throw the first grenade after getting instruction from Sayeed. The others would throw their grenades at around the same time. Hannan said the attackers targeted the truck and left the spot individually after the operation. However question remains as why HUJI chose to attack Hasina after all those years and during the period when there was a row of political killings of Awami League leaders (Kibria, Ahsan Master etc.) were happening. HUJI members were used but who masterminded the attack? The BNP connection: In January 2008, former deputy minister for information of the BNP government Abdus Salam Pintu was arrested for his involvement with the grenade attacks on Awami League rally on August 21 in 2004. He was arrested on the basis of confessional statement made earlier by detained Mufti Hannan who claimed that the attack on the AL rally was planned at the official residence of the former Deputy Minister. Hannan said that Pintu was present at the meeting and later supplied the grenades. He made startling disclosure to interrogators about the involvement of former State Minister of Home Lutfuzzaman Babar and Hawa Bhaban in the grenade attacks. From The New Nation: The CID officer said they were certain after the arrest of Mufti Hannan and Pintu that the attack on the AL rally had been aided and abetted by Lutfuzzaman Babar and the Hawa Bhaban. To hide the truth, former investigation officer Ruhul Amin, a CID officer, had gone to Pintus house several times, he said, and added, former State Minister of Home Babar was involved in the entire process and Pintu would regularly inquire with him about the progress. Pintus counsel Advocate Sanaullah Mia, however, told : He was implicated only because his cousin Maulana Tajul Islam, a militant leader and an accused in the grenade attack case, had visited his house when Pintu was a Minister, HUJI is the culprit but who used them and why? On June 11, 2008 charges were finally made against 22 persons including top Harkat-ul-Jihad (Huji) leader Mufti Abdul Hannan and BNP leader and former deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu. Newspaper reports say: CID Chief Additional Inspector General Jabed Patwari said HUJI top leaders planned and carried out the attacks to kill Hasina as a few arrested attackers said in their confessional statements that Hasina would harm Islam if she was alive and came to power again. BNP leader Pintu is not involved with Huji but he has been charged since the attackers had held two meetings at his residence to take decision about the attack. But the question remains whether HUJI tried to kill Hasina on their own or it was a political assassination plot linked by BNP to take out the opposition. Like every other political massacre the 21st August grenade attack on Hasina has no clear motive whatsoever and after 4 years of investigation we are not certain whether those who were behind this ghastly attack have finally been exposed. Will we be able to know the truth?  "

The film was released in 1991 when Demi Moore was 29 years old. She is now 50 years old or very close.  She carries the movie along with Jeff Daniels and they are backed up by some phenomenal supporting people.  I watched the movie three times yesterday and today, before my rental rental period was up.  I was hoping to sate myself in it, so I won't have to spend money buying it. (Hey, I'm a depression brat...we're cheap.)    ... Demi Moore has become one of my favorite performers.  She is able to do almost anything on screen, and some of her adult roles have generated hate and criticism among the ""born again"" clan who only a few years ago were sitting smugly in front of their TV sets, discussing how evil, sinful and lecherous the movie industry was.  About this time in her career, Demi began to earn over ten million dollars per movie.  She was the first female to make that breakthrough. I doubt if she gives a ratzazz what the bible thumpers say.  ... in the role of Marina Lempke, the butcher's wife, Demi plays the part of a rural North Carolina girl, raised in the lighthouse keeper's cottage on North Carolina's Baldhead Island shore.  The visuals in both North Carolina and New York are fantastic, and the photography (cinematography) is brilliant.    ... Demi has acquired such a pure southern accent, I could close my eyes and visualize my mother and my aunts from central Texas talking.  She even moves like a country girl with great natural grace, but a very unsophisticated erect, arched body posture, that is the mark of southern rural female self-confidence.  I was trying to remember that North Carolina has that added ""there's a moose in the hoose, get it oote syndrome along with regular southern American English, but maybe not.  In any case it's not a part of Marina's accent.  As of this movie, I've put Demi Moore into the category of Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep as performers to look for to be guaranteed you won't be disappointed.  She is a joy to watch.  ... Jeff Daniels is the mast of the genre of humor that John Ritter did so well with, but I think Jeff is a less limited performer.  He has that one secret element that shoots so many performers down ... he had believability.  His anger scenes in this film are a joy to watch.  ... George Dzondza, as the butcher, is adequate and believable.  He doesn't really blossom until he hears Stella sing the blues in his favorite bar and that introduces the third most important person to the review.  .... Stella Keefover is played by Mary Steenburgen, who does a scrumptious job as a meek and milk church music director and even does her on singing in the bar when she decides, at Marina's suggestion, to become a blues singer.  She is actually an authentic blues singer. The right side of your brain almost dances with the words as she reluctantly lets them slip over the edge of her lips and fall gently into the microphone.   ... I have no complaints with any of the cast.  I'm in awe of the screenwriters and all in all, this is one helluva story, beautifully told..  Cast:      * Luis Avalos as Luis     * Margaret Colin as Robyn Graves     * Jeff Daniels as Dr. Alex Tremor     * George Dzundza as Leo Lemke     * Helen Hanft as Molly     * Elizabeth Lawrence as Grammy D'Arbo     * Miriam Margolyes as Gina     * Frances McDormand as Grace     * Demi Moore as Marina Lemke     * Max Perlich as Eugene     * Diane Salinger as Trendoid     * Mary Steenburgen as Stella Keefover  Here's Wikipedia on the film ...  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Butcher%27s_Wife "

Staring at my sub-staff of bums, expats and locals when it has been raining for 3 days now, with furious winds all over the metro area, lying in bed or pedalling to work and I just feel like Im off.  I dreamed that I was at a party checking tattoo listings when I noticed her face idling carelessly, smooth, shiny, staring at me. I closed my eyes and let the tropical warm waves wash away my wrinkles, the crummy chats and the expensive white palms. Restless, when I opened my eyes I saw a blue-eyed boy with red hair falling forward on his sunglasses, smoking from a crack-pipe. He was shaking. He had a gun, a silly huge black thing. And I saw her again, still, eyes open, smiling, calm, happy that it was over. She had a tiny hole on each side of her forehead. The party was on, following the score of laughs, small-talks, advances and fake palm trees.  At twelve I wake up with the word meds pounding in my head with a tickling voodoo, a reassuring view of empty cans and a plan to coddle her, the Caribbean in the viewfinder and leftover work absolved on plenary indulgence.  La mare, she whispers, la mare, pointing at the salt lines soaking the swamps. La mare, yes.  I force myself to visit the backyard barber. I get out bold and hairless and senseless in a rain of snowflakes and tears, a Blueberry and several cups in Third Ave at Starbucks where I meet her and her smooth cluster of pendants, secretaries and insurers on daily rations of lemon, chiffon pie and espresso. Walking south-west, realise only after an hour that we are in Times Square. Get a room and hit at each other like animals for two hours.  In the hall having a break between a doughnut and a sip of coke shes listing reasons why jobs at the burger's line suck. Rolling eyes methodically, aligning her gaze with no regret or anger, playing with her chin and expressions, she whips her communication into a vector of calibrated empathy.  This is my card, my job and this is my name. Yes, my name."

London, 15.05.2011    In what proved to be a tense, often volatile demonstration yesterday, pro-Palestinian protesters gathered to celebrate ""Yamn an-Nakbah"" - the ""day of catastrophe"" which refers to the forced displacement of the palestinian people following the creation of the state of Israel in 1948, and to condemn the continuing violent occupation of Palestine. The Arab protesters were vigorously opposed by a much smaller counter-protest group of Israelis, whose meagre numbers were disproportionately increased by several members of the English Defence League (EDL) and its offshoot, March for England (MfE), which are both Ultra-Nationalist supremacy groups.  Penned up by the police within close range to each other, there were frequent provocative moves made by both sides, taunting and insulting each other, and occasionally individuals would escape the barriers and run over to the opposition group to openly taunt them. The bitterness and anger hung like a thick fog in the air. Across the road on the opposite pavement two smaller groups protested too, kept apart by ever-increasing numbers of police as the temperature rose amongst the more hot-headed protesters, each hoping to antagonise the other into some kind of physical reaction to their taunts. Passers-by were clearly intimidated by the growing tension, and hurried nervously by on the crowded pavement.  The police did an admirable job of containing the situation without resorting to strong-arm tactics, quickly diffusing pockets of potential trouble as they arose. There was one arrest before I left.

Would you mind looking at this shot, thinking about what it means to you (if anything) taking the time to read what I have to say, and then thinking again about what it all means?  The thing is I posted this shot before a long while back and Ill be damned if I didnt think that this was it. This was the apogee, the gilded pinnacle of all that I could ever achieve with my camera. And maybe it is, subjectivity and all that being taken into account, but I dont realty believe that.  Now that series (the first I really started using words and images side by side) was pretty sure of what it was. It was about anger. Most of all it was about my anger and my once awful temper. The words that topped and tailed the 5 images dealt solely with that emotion and the deeds that came with it, nothing else was considered or even analysed.  Im planning a trip away at the moment and time is tight and energy levels low so instead of new shots, Ive been reworking old images and seeing what else I could tease out of them. What has actually happened is that the fucking clown has messed with my head to the point that everything that was defined and complete about shots like this are open territory for interpretation and analysis all over again instead if mere re-processing.  You see, on the positive side, what old clown face did was give me a voice that kicked down some emotional walls that I built up around a whole host of issues. He really helped me to see a lot of things about myself in a new, sometimes bright, sometimes sleazy light. What I saw were patterns of error and swirls of good fortune that Id never seen before. I saw forces that had been constants of sane and reasoned thought, and bursts of irrational, erratic behaviour. I exaggerate not when I say that the whole process exorcised the clinging remains of a lot of ghosts, and opened up parts of my memory to stories and people who had long been replaced by the smothering hum of the everyday.   However, you dont let an armed clown (shotgun: check, knife: check) run around in your memory without some negative repercussions. To elaborate, I always thought of my memory as being something like Cohens Tower of Song. Each level of this synapse created tower contains a stage in my life, a version of me who forged his own routes and lost his own way. There was the youthful Gavin, the teenage years Gavin, the Loved up years Gavin and the HOLY FUCK WHAT JUST HAPPENED Gavin. Each of these Gavins is the curator of his own museum with all of his stories and moments of glory each stored up in little rooms for ease of access.  That was an idea I could cope with. In that version of my inner workings was order, progress, ascending maturity and a series of ready to access novellas for each stage of my life. Now, keep all of that order in mind, for I am about to tell you what I really found.  Hundreds of Gavins! I mean it, in there are hundreds of the little, side-burned, charming, inarticulate, funny, boring, sensual, clumsy little bastards. Whats more, there is no calmly ordered tower. No, what I have is one big fucking dorm room where all of these Gavins are careering around, some befitting their character having a hell of a time, others cowering in the corner wishing they had chosen someone elses brain to make their stay in. Whats more, remember the idea of the curated rooms and the self-contained stories that lie within? Fuck off. There are little rooms to be sure, but the Gavins up in there pay no heed to deed or date. They fly through each door with erratic frequency in spontaneous bursts of emotion. Each swirling movement sends the neat pages of that time in my life flapping wildly in the passing breeze. So much for vacuum packed nostalgia, what I have is drive through memory.  So what has the clown to do with this? Well, it may or may not have been clear to you, but there was contradiction between each tale, and often within the same page of words in that series. I would describe a self who thought he could take on the world with a cheeky grin and a quick word and then proceed to recall languorous days of emotional torpor and plunging self-esteem.   Now that is fine, you move through stages, become a different you, shed your skin and slide along to the next big adventure. Thats life right? Packaged, segmented and easy to understand. However, the more I let the stupid Ronald McDonald lookalike do his foreign correspondent bit from my deepest recesses, the more he reported on an emotional orgy which showed no inclination to portray any signs of linear personal development. What his reporting back showed me was that the version of me who once proudly dated 4 girls at once was the very same quivering chap who wanted the world and all its women to leave him well alone. The Gavin that swaggered into a veritable shitstorm of life disasters uber confident of his immortality was, at the very same fucking moment, cowering in the dark wondering where his life was headed and who was going to save him from all this doubt.   In other words, for all that the clown helped me make sense of a lot that I never knew existed, he also stopped to pick up some of the emotional slop that swills around in my mind and has kindly left a handful of it lying in front of me to analyse as he passed through the exit door.  The more I looked at the mess, and the more I looked at this shot and what I thought it was previously, the more I realised that I got it all wrong. Yes I have a temper, yes, Ive done some pretty awful things with it in the past and yes, I really hope that its worst excesses remain items for an inglorious past. What it is I know in addition to this though is that my temper, my anger, in fact all the things I have done, be they exemplars of moral behaviour or guzzling grit in the gutter with the worst of them, they dont emanate from some freeze dried off the shelf emotional side of me. They cant be explained away as a phase or a moment I was going through. A time of my life when I was angry or sad, lacking in self esteem or sodden with ego. I was all of those things all of the time and I always have been. I just never saw it that way before.  So now, this shot which was the artistic epitome of my angry days is now, to my eyes a splintered mess of everything that is there within me. Up there is the Gavin that writes these words with confidence and poise, lying above or below him is the persona who reads his own words and blanches with embarrassment at the flaws and mistakes. What I once proudly saw as fitful rage expressed in physical form is now so much more, or so much less.  That shot to me now is a fragmented emblem of the peeling reverberations that ring out when emotions and desires clash inside my swirling head. I now understand that it is these clashes and collisions that make me who I am and which, depending on the mix and the moment, lift me so high or drag me so low.  Where there was once anger and nothing more, I can now see frustration, self-pity, fear, confidence and even joy. I dont yet know if this pleases me or if I feel robbed of another certainty, no matter how prosaic and pretentious it was. So, if you got all the way to here, I was just wondering, what do you see? If you see anything at all. "

The dharna was two hour long where representatives from various civil society groups gathered to demonstrate their solidarity with the people of Kashmir. Following people expressed their views in protest: Shabnam Hashmi (ANHAD), Harsh Kapoor (South Asia Citizens Web), Navaid Hamid (Member,NIC), Prof. Kamal Mitra Chenoy (JNU), Prof. Anuradha Chenoy (JNU), Tanveer Hussain Khan (ANHAD), Indu Prakash (IGSSS), Madhu Chandra (North Eastern Helpline), Divya (YWCA), Sanjay Kumar (AAA), Amitabh Pandey (Free Lancer), Ravi Himadri (The other Media), Prof. Rizwan Kaisar (Jamia Millia Islamia), Swami Agnivesh, Mansi Sharma (ANHAD), Seema Duhan (ANHAD). The following statement was released to the Media.  It is a matter of grave concern and anguish that no sensitive measures have been taken by the Central Government in response to the ongoing deaths, injuries and killings in cold-blood of civilians in Srinagar and Anantnag districts of Jammu and Kashmir, including young girls and boys, most of them innocent, peaceful protestors, or even just bystanders. And consequently both North and South regions of the valley are on flame. To make matters worse, the Army, along with para-military forces, have been issued orders to shoot at sight to uphold the almost relentless curfew -- basically to block protests against the continuing spiral of non-stop and indiscriminate killings of innocent civilians. The presence of army and security forces dominates the Valley and reinforces the deep-rooted angst of people. The reality is that democracy is under severe strain and is almost absent in many parts in this state, despite an elected government backed by the Centre holding the reigns of power at Srinagar.  ANHAD and many other concerned civil society groups in India want the governments in the state and Centre to come out clean -- urgently and immediately -- and explain if this is indeed a democratic and constitutional method of handling a manifold and multiplying crisis in a highly sensitive region. Obviously, the establishment thinks that branding it as mere law and order problem and repression and killings would 'calm down' the situation as sensitive and grim as that of Jammu and Kashmir. This will be like choking tens of thousands of people into the silence of absolute suffering and blind rage. Will this violence ever stop, and will we ever find the root causes for a political solution based on consensus, understanding, mutual harmony and human rights?  Tuesday began with protests against one death which led to the second death and then suddenly, Srinagar was back under curfew. The cycle of violence has spun out of control all over again. Last week witnessed a similar series of killings taking its toll in Anantnag district where people were killed in clashes with security forces since they were not allowed to protest against the killings of civilians. This has become a tragic and vicious circle of hopelessness.  Instead of issuing any statement of sympathy or concern or wisdom, our highest offices of governance in the country, are only pushing for an escalation in the number of deployment of security forces. This clearly indicates the callous attitude of the governments in Delhi and Srinagar. Such acts of brutality are in complete violation of the law of the land and constitutional rights of the people that have resulted in mass outrage and alienation of large sections of the civilian population in Kashmir.  These are unarmed, non-violent citizens, who are being treated with such blatant and indiscriminate use of military force -- why? Is there no other way to negotiate with civil unrest? And what is the root cause of this civil unrest if not the brutalities executed by the police and para military forces? And what about cases of atrocities committed on people who are not even protesting?  There is no excuse for such cruelty. Despite repeated assurances by the central and state governments of zero tolerance towards human rights violations, the fact remains that little has been done to punish those responsible for such heinous and gross violations. This organised insensitivity and vacillation to act firmly against such elements is bound to put a question mark on the credibility of the State and its track record in terms of human and democratic rights of the people, as enshrined in the Indian Constitution. Mere rhetoric and institution of official enquiries is not enough to restore the shattered and shaken confidence of the people. It is imperative that the central and state authorities take firm and visible action against those responsible for unleashing this brutish violence on innocent people. Any delay will only compound the alienation and anger of the people -- resulting in irrefutable damage to the peace process in the Valley and elsewhere in the state.  ANHAD expresses serious concern over the absolute antipathy and lack of political initiative displayed by the UPA-led central government in response to the situation in the valley. They should learn some lessons from history. People cannot be won over or suppressed at gun point. Certainly, the people of Jammu and Kashmir deserve a more rational, humane, visionary and sensitive response from the Indian State.  We demand from the Central and the State governments to:  Take immediate action to prevent further loss of life and property Put an end to the violence perpetrated by the security forces with immediate effect. Immediately appoint an independent and impartial time bound Commission of Enquiry to look into the killings of peaceful civilians & human rights violations Initiate an inquiry into instances of attacks on ambulance services Ensure  security of the journalists both of local and national media Ensure freedom of expression and press Immediately start a political dialogue with various stake holders  Endorsed By:  1.

Personality: Marthos is a Darwinist extremist. Survival of the fittest is not the strong feasting upon the weak. Darwin didnt take his theory far enough. The strong dont get strong by feasting on the weak. They get stronger by eating the weak AND those tougher as they are. Marthos holds no respect for those that cant carry their own weight or those that pick on the weak. Only through testing yourself against your equals or betters can you hope to survive.  History:  In the year of our lord 1776, Young Marthos who was known as William back than had reached his 21st birthday and joined up with the congressional army. He had the honor and privilege to listen to the Father of America speak about high ideals and freedom. Williams heart swelled with pride for the budding nation and he threw himself into its defense.   During his time with the congressional army when food was scarce he would gobble down the lizards or salamanders that he found. In time, he grew to enjoy the taste of reptiles. Having journeyed down into the bayous of the deep south, during the French and Indian war, he dined on alligators and crocodiles whenever he could. However, that angered the Indians who dwelled there and their Shamans placed a terrible curse upon him. From that day, Hed exist as the reptiles that he devoured but would keep his mortal mind so that he would despair.  And despair he did for the first decade but in time the pain dulled and faded. Leaving him a monster in a wild world. Although his body changed, his heart and mind didnt. No longer human, he took the name Marthos but the Indians who changed him dubbed him, Shiatan or hell wyrm. He learned what he could do with those body and kept careful tabs on the country he fought to build. From then on, during each major war that America fought in, Marthos traveled to those locations be stowing away or even walking whenever he couldnt hide on a transport. Hed harass the enemies but never stepped into direct fight. That was until the modern era. With a sudden surge of people beyond human abilities, Marthos struck out into the foreground as a vicious fighter, whose methods were looked down upon by the just. He would brutally attack targets he deemed to be threats with no mercy. Men or women or machine. It didnt matter, they were viciously cut down in hit and runs or sabotaged. His might and muscle gave him the power necessary to move forward in life. The strong make the rules and the future of America will be built on the corpses of the weak. That was life to Marthos.  Then surprisingly, he was asked to lecture at a college designed to teach and train students with similar abilities. Although he was disliked by many, no one doubted his knowledge and experience for the past 230 years. We didnt study the past, he lived it. He IS the past. And so, he decided to see if any at the school were fit to receive his knowledge and skills. ~ Additional Information ~[/b]  "

It was the biggest demonstration against the government since David Cameron went into Downing Street.  Students and lecturers take the initiative and give a focus for the hatred millions feel about the Tory cuts and gave confidence that militant protest is the way to push back the attacks.  The 50,000 students, lecturers and other protesters who took to the streets were fighting 9,000-a-year tuition fees that will close university education to most working class students. They are also fighting against the cuts in courses and staff, and the ending of the Education Maintenance Allowance.  The mood of anger that has swept Europe arrived in London. The lively protest was filled with anger as protestors chanted Tory scum.  But they were also revolting about much more too. The demoand the occupation of the Tory headquarters in the Millbank Towerwere a sign of the fury against the Tories pampering the rich while assaulting the poor.  And it showed the anger at a society where profit comes before any human need. Tory headquarters at Millbank is the symbol of all that.  As the demonstration marched past, a large group broke away into the buildings courtyard. Then some occupied the foyer.  More and more joined them until up to 5,000 students and lecturers were protesting against the Tories blocking the road outside. They brushed aside the few police officers defending the Tory tower.  Protesters lit bonfires in the courtyard and chanted against the Tories.  Some demonstrators smashed several of the buildings front windowsto massive cheers. And protesters on the pavement sat on office chairs, and a sofa theyd removed from the building."

Thousands of university, college and school students  joined by workers  are marching in London and Manchester against Tory cuts to education, fee rises and attacks on jobs and services.  The revolution in Tunisia and uprising in Egypt have clearly inspired the marches. Marchers have chanted, Egypt, Egypt everywhere.  London  Aisha, an FE student from Camden in north London said, Ive been on all the demonstrations, but some of my friends are here who havent been out on the protests before.   I like the slogan This is only the beginning, because its going to be a long fight against this government.  Theo, a school student from south east London, took part in the Day X walkouts last year. He said, Lots of people who want to go to university wont be able to and people will definitely be affected by the cuts to EMA [Education Maintenance Allowance]. The government is making the wrong people pay  the bankers are getting hundreds of thousands in bonuses. For workers, the student protests have been an inspiration.  A GMB rep joining the protest in London said, Im here to show solidarity with the students. Ive got a daughter who has just gone through university and there is no way she would have been able to afford 9,000 a year fees.  Im also here to say that I dont believe in these cuts. Weve got to stick together workers and students. I think that the TUC demo on the 26 March can give people confidence to fight.  UCU lecturer Vicky Margree works at the University of Brighton. She said, We face 100 percent cut in arts and humanities funding which will hit universities hard. And the new fees will make university unaffordable for the majority of people.  Kelly Rogers, a Unison organiser, said, Unless we show solidarity with younger people we may as well give up. Students have led the way and enthused workers, showing us how to fight.  Solidarity with the Egyptian uprising  In London the mood was electric as up to a thousand students joined the many hundreds of people already protesting in solidarity with the Egyptian people outside the embassy off Park Lane.  Chants of Solidarity, solidarity, London and Cairo unite and fight and Hey ho Mubarak has to go are ringing through the air.  One man on the original protest said, I cant believe that all these young people have come to support us. This makes us feel even stronger. I cant wait to send the pictures of all you British people who have come to support us to people back home.  Before reaching the embassy, the protest stopped outside the Tory HQ at Millbank  a focus of student anger and protests last year  as students chanted, Tory scum, here we come.

MPs voted by 323 to 302 to allow fees to rise to up to 9,000 a year. A coalition majority of 80 fell to 21. Tens of thousands protested in London on Thursday, and thousands elsewhere. This is not the end, but the beginning of a new phase of revolt.  Students, their parents and many workers will feel a deeper anger now.  A cabinet of 18 millionaires has wrecked the future of millions of young people. It wants to move on to do the same for those who rely on Education Maintenance Allowance.

AND IS OUR ""LITTLE MAN"" PRESIDENT GONNA BE PISSED AT THIS GUY   Robert Rizzo, a former city manager to the Los Angeles suburb of Bell, was among eight current and former city officials arrested Tuesday in a corruption investigation. Rizzo's exorbitant salary was what ignited the public's anger and led to the police sweep today.  The district attorney's office said several City Council members were taken into custody along with ex-city manager Robert Rizzo and Mayor Oscar Hernandez.  ""This, needless to say, is corruption on steroids,"" District Attorney Steve Cooley said at a news conference in Los Angeles     The district attorney, state attorney general and others have been conducting investigations of officials in the small working-class city since it was disclosed they were paying themselves huge salaries. Rizzo was making nearly $800,000 a year.  The investigations involve allegations of corruption, misuse of public funds and voter fraud in the city where one in six of the 40,000 residents live in poverty.  A message left at Rizzo's Huntington Beach home was not immediately returned.  Cooley said one arrest required authorities to use a battering ram.  The suspects were booked into county facilities and will be kept away from other inmates for their protection, Los Angeles County sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said.  The arrests were the latest twist in a scandal that emerged in July with the disclosure that Rizzo was paid almost twice the salary of President Barack Obama.  It also was revealed that former Police Chief Randy Adams was making $457,000 a year, and Assistant City Manager Angela Spaccia was paid $376,288. Four of the five City Council members paid themselves nearly $100,000 a year for their part-time service.  Rizzo, Adams and Spaccia resigned and the council members reduced their salaries to about $8,000 following the disclosures and angry public reaction. The four council members are currently the target of a recall.

We are closely related to our emotions, especially those shown through our face and gestures of our hands. We interact through these emotions, the four main emotions Ive depicted in my pieces: anger, grief, joy, and frustration.

Marchers came from all around the Midlands and beyond. Trade Union banners showed the breadth of union participation. Marchers were angry at the role the Lib Dems have played in propping up the Tories in office. From Fees to Academies to cuts, no matter what the issue, the Lib Dems are helping the Tories drive through their policies of privatisation and cuts.  In 2 weeks time thousands more will gather to march on the Tory conference. On 30th November up to 3 million public sector workers will strike against the ConDem attacks on pensions.  Speakers from the platform reflected the breadth of anger and resistance that exists in society. Mary Bousted from the ATL said that unequal distribution of wealth means kids come to school anxious because parents fear losing job. Mark Serwotka from the PCS said that  November 30 will be biggest strike for generations  we have to fight to win the ballots. He condemned Ed Miliband for condemning strikes and said he should side with workers fighting back. He ended his speech with  Fight every cut! Defend every job. Free education. Tax the rich!   Christine Blower from the NUT said she was proud her members were on strike on June 30 and they will be out on November30. We will defend our pensions. Fight on every campaign. Billy Hayes from the CWU announced to cheers that Posties wont cross picket Lines on November 30th  Right to Work is proud of the role we have played in this demonstration. We initially called the demonstration before the TUC decided to run one themselves. We were pleased with their decision to do this. Right to Work placards ran through the demonstration, reflecting the role Right to Work has played in the last few weeks in leafletting and mobilising for the demo.  250 people packed the Right to Work rally after the demonstration.

This is the card that tells the Querent that they can't keep smoking and drinking without consequences to their health. It is the card that advises cutting out waste and insists that the Querent make adjustments, do whatever is necessary to bring things back into balance: physically, emotionally, socially, spiritually. In a more mundane sense, this card may signal a court case, legal documents, adjustments in a marriage or partnership. The outcome of all of these may not be exactly what the Querent wants, but it will be a scrupulously fair outcome. If the card is reversed, it can indicate bias, obstruction of the law, or legal complications.   I love this moment, in so many ways. THIS is the Dean Winchester you never want to meet. The fierce protector of his brother where there is no appeal or denial. I actually merged two pictures of that scene to get the gun and his face in focus.

Im fascinated by building on an older style- like the pin-up girl- who many say was perfected by Sailor Jerry, who mixed skull, danger and snake motifs together with a busty beauty. He combined both masculine and feminine icons to create pinups that were bordering on dangerous (Mans Ruin was a common banner placed across an ample butt).  I like to push this hybrid pinup one step further and draw deeper, darker, more overtly sexual figures evoking a dark goddess figure. These ladies embody the attributes of a Sheela-Na-Gig of ancient Ireland, Ishtar of Mesopotamia, Isis of Egypt and Inanna of Summeria. The goddesses are life-givers and life-destroyers- not merely sexual toys.   I was also heavily influenced by punk rock feminism and the riot grrl movement. There exists an aggression and anger in my pin-ups that also reflects these principles, as well as from my own personal experiences.  I was such a shy soft-spoken good girl reared on Midwestern 80s pop culture. But what I was drawn to as an adolescent- the freak scene, the art kids, the queers, and losers- put me on the outside of normal in my Kansas hometown.  The music and DIY aesthetics of bands like Hole, Bikini Kill, and The Voluptuous Horror of Karen Black gave me courage to carry on.  I still tap this vein of emotion when drawing my pin-ups. They dare you to call them a bitch "

Further marches were held in Hongdae, Seoul, on May 3 and then in Gumi, Gyeongbuk, on May 5 and Jeonju, North Jeolla Province, on May 6. In addition to Jeju Island, marches will be held across the country on May 10.  The marches are in response to the Sewol ferry tragedy when passengers were ordered by the captain to stay still in your compartments, while he was one of the first to be rescued from the vessel. The fateful order has been adopted as a sign of defiance to highlight the authorities negligence in not being able to save a single passenger after the first day of the sinking.  The latest round of marches will begin at 2 p.m. in Hongdae and move toward Myeongdong and Gojan Station in Seoul. The event will be marked on Jeju at 7 p.m. at Jeju City Hall.  The first march attracted 200 marchers and twice as many attended the second event. Yong hopes that this third event can continue this momentum across the country and events are also being planned in Daegu, Incheon, Pohang and Daejeon at various times.  I think we must spread the words of the people who will no longer stand still. From now on even if it is not in the form of a march we must spread the I will not stay still movement, said Yong.  www.jejuweekly.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=4021"

Although there was an overnight lull in the clashes between protesters and riot police in Athens and other cities the peace was once again broken this afternoon when high school student marchers protesting the death of 15 year old, Andreas Grigoropoulos turned violent. Once more the central police station Thessaloniki, The country's second largest city came under attack. Unconfirmed eye witness accounts say that the police arrested a 13 year old girl during the event.  With the smell of burning plastic and tear gas hanging over much of the centre Thessaloniki resembles a war zone with heavily armoured riot police taking and re-taking strategic points along the central Egnatia Boulevard. In keeping with the tenets of guerrilla warfare their opponent simply retreat from the onslaught simply to reappear elsewhere within minutes.  Anarchist protesters have also taken over much of the university campus and other off campus departments such as the school of theatre where huge banners are hanging from the upper floor windows and loud rock music is blasting out.  In the face of such wide spread resistance the riot police appear unable to maintain order in the city. The situation seems to have slipped out the authorities ability to control. Traffic is still being allowed to enter riot zones around the university even though drivers are coming under attack with stones and paving blocks.   With two more protest rallies scheduled today at 6pm today in Athens and Thessaloniki there is little likelihood that tensions will lessen and protesters go home. Indeed more and more cities throughout the country are reporting unrest.  The latest revelation that the dead teenager was apparently shot in cold blood by a police officer in the Exarchia district on Saturday has simply added to the anger and frustration that many young Greeks feel over the situation in the country as a whole. Rising unemployment, low wages and limited prospects have helped fuel a toxic mix which is easily ignited. However, it should be noted that while violent street clashes are not unusual in Greece the length, duration and intensity of these latest episodes has taken many by surprise.  my.nowpublic.com/world/greek-riots-enter-third-day"
