It usually falls on the 15th day of the first lunar month. Tibetan people will gather together in the temples to celebrate this festival.  Tibetan people in festive costumes gather in the local temples on the morning of the Sunning of Buddha Festival for the Sunning Buddha ceremony.  Accompanying Buddhist music played by lamas, Tibetan men carry the Buddhist tapestry from the temple to a clean and well-lit hillside. The tapestry is then unfolded along the hillside by the lamas, starting the Sunning of Buddha Festival.  Pious Buddhists kowtow and chant sutras beneath the giant Buddha spreading out before them, praying to the Buddha for blessings.  The Sunning of Buddha ceremony lasts for several hours, after which the lamas will fold the Buddha tapestry in awe. They will walk around the temple three times with the folded tapestry on their shoulders and then put it back where it is kept. from:  www.chinadaily.com.cn/m/gansu/2013-10/10/content_17021362... www.flickr.com/photos/rietje/show/"

Access to the Castle is sometimes restricted by higher-than-usual levels of water in the Loch, at which times the site effectively becomes a temporary island.  It was the ancestral home of the Campbells of Glen Orchy, who later became the Earls of Breadalbane also known as the Breadalbane family branch, of the Clan Campbell. The earliest construction on the castle was the towerhouse and Laich Hall (looks onto Loch Awe). Today, its picturesque setting and romantic state of decay make it one of the most photographed structures in Scotland. "

Although the site was known in Aztec times as the 'Birthplace of the Gods' it is actually significantly older, with most of the major structures built between 100-250AD and the city, one of the largest ever ancient settlements in the Americas, was believed to have been still inhabited up to the 8th century.  Today the vast scale of the complex, particularly the so called Avenue of the Dead, nearly 3km long and flanked by ancient ruins and terraces, continues to awe visitors. At the north end of the Avenue sits the Pyramid of the Moon, whilst it's much larger counterpart, the Pyramid of the Sun, sits halfway up it's eastern side. At the southern end sits the Ciudadela complex which centres on the smaller pyramid of Quetzelcoatl, earlier and more ruined than the larger pyramids but retaining it's stunning original sculptural decoration on part of it's western face, featuring the iconic feathered serpent heads.  Aside from the great ceremonial structures there are also residential buildings, particularly the palatial complex at the north west corner that retains some vivid fragments of it's original mural decoration.  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teotihuacan"

Bob-ah-qwah is iridescent aqua, deep blue and white.  Bob-a-lou in the photo is a Half Moon Betta.  When he is on full alert, his tail makes a half circle.  As you can see in the photo, his tail is somewhat clear with those blue stripes in it.  Bob-a-lou has a cute pink face with dark blue eyes.  It makes his face look a bit human at the right angle.     Their gorgeous colors are really difficult to capture without a flash, and the plastic habitats are reflective and/or show scratches I dont see with my eyes.  So my seven handsome boys will be an ongoing project.  Why do we have so many Bettas?  Well, partly because when I see one looking kind of sickly at the pet store, I rescue them.  Bob-ah-qwah was kind of pathetic looking when I brought him home.  He had no color.  I never understood people buying the pale Bettas when there are so many vibrant specimens.  I gave him a nice sized habitat, and lots of high protein food.  Bob-ah-qwah thrived, and took on his gorgeous iridescent aqua blue hues on his body and into his fins.  Some of his fins are still white, but they shimmer and shine.    Bobcat is the newest Bob.  He just came home today.  He is a dragon scale crown tail.  I had never seen one before, and I was kind of awe struck.  Bobcat is huge and gorgeous.  Pinky reds and purples along with some blue.  I take really good care of my Bettas, and I even change out their decorations to give them something new to look at in their environment.  Our neighbor fed them while we were gone for Thanksgiving, and I left a note on each of them with their name, and any special instructions.  Bob-inski does not eat the same food as everyone else.  He just wont.  They all love flakes, but Bob-inski likes balls, LOL!  Good thing, thats what my aquarium fish eat, (Seabiscuit the Dwarf Gourami, and Leonard and Nimoy the Rasboras).  We named the Gourami Seabiscuit because hes the racehorse of that tank.  The tank is round, a BioOrb, and Biscuit loves to swim laps, around and around and around!

This shot is a pano comprised of six or so frames shot from probably not the best angle but the only spot that was open  as I ran back to the rail.   As I mentioned in my earlier post, a fire broke out just above El Portal last Saturday around 3:15, just as we were passing Bakersfield.  By the time we reached the turnoff for Glacier Point, the flames were visible from the roadway and a huge column of smoke was towering high above the Sierras.  When we reached Glacier point, we found out that not one, but two fires were now burning in the park.  The column of smoke in the middle of the frame was from a lightning strike which they were allowing to burn.  The El Portal fire, on the other hand, quickly burned through 2000 acres  and was looking very threatening indeed by the time we drove through.    I should also mention that PLENTY of flames were visible as we drove back down from Glacier Point.  We stopped, along with quite a few other cars, and just watched in awe as flames towered over pines across the valley.  No homes were threatened, but it was so sad to see even more of the forest on that side below Crane Flats lost to fire.  So much of that part of the forest already burned away a few years ago.    After our four hour ordeal to make it to Tenaya Lake, we finally made down out of the Tioga Pass to Mono Lake by 4 AM.  More on that in my next post.

We would like to share our experience of the visit to Longwood Gardens 2014 Christmas Spectacular (the main theme this year is BIRDS).  The festivities begin on Thanksgiving Day and continues through the end of the first week of 2015.  In recent years, we have found that it works perfectly for us to go on Thanksgiving Day, for we would celebrate TG early and afterward.  This allows an opening day attendance at Longwood, where the crowd is significantly less than during the peak weekend days.  There will be a good number of photos to view, and for the most part, presented in correct sequence.  Please check out our ALBUMS titled LONGWOOD GARDENS of Kennett Square, PA and/or CHRISTMAS SCENES for a better flow in exploring the photos, since the continuity is lost when uploading into FLICKR while many others are doing the same, thus, having a variety of shots mixed in between the ones representing our visit on this day.    The wide variety of flowers and plants at Longwood Gardens are absolutely stunning in all stages and species . . . truly a Garden of Eden for anyone with a deep passion for these gifts of nature.  The annual Longwood Gardens Christmas never fails to awe the visitors with one spectacular display after another.  Whether these are in the magnificently elegant grand Conservatory, or outdoors within the over 1,000 acres of fabulous grounds, each and every thing is meticulously planned and designed, always arriving at some fresh ideas and/or concepts, while also maintaining the traditionally classic holiday floral and lighting appointments throughout.  Given that the main theme for the 2014 holiday season is BIRDS, this can be seen in such spectacularly tasteful fashion throughout the displays of the vast indoor landscape.  From the moment one enters the architectural marvel of the Conservatory, whether through the main Orangery or the East Conservatory, an awe inspiring view awaits. "

It represents the third stage in that king's elaborate building plans at Luxor Temple, and though it chronologically precedes the Great Court, it follows that element geographically. Indeed, this one hundred meter long colonnade is a part of the oldest segment of this temple.  These fourteen great columns in two rows erected during Amenhotep III's reign, though only completed after his death, may have originally been intended as the main axis of what was to become a great hypostyle hall, similar to the one at Karnak. However, if that is true, it was never finished. The colonnade was finished during the reign of Tutankhamun, Ay and Horemheb.  The axis of this colonnade, as well as the chambers south of it, is clearly different than the later Ramesside additions that precede it in the temple. We believe that the change was made after Ramesses II decided to physically connect Luxor Temple by a causeway with the Temple of Khonsu at Karnak, which had a different axial alignment.  The columns, which stand 19 meters high, have open papyrus capitals that support a roof 21 meters above the ground. They are surmounted by abacus, which in turn support architrave blocks. The space is narrow, being only ten meters wide. Originally, it had walls that rose to the full height of the roof, with only small clerestory windows cut at the ceiling level to allow in sunlight. However, it is difficult today to appreciate just how impressive this chamber must have been, because the walls now only rise some a few meters high. Yet, to have walked into this dark and forbidding colonnade during ancient times, passing from the open, brightly lit courtyard must have been awe inspiring [touregypt.net]"

I didn't find a front row seat to a blockbuster film, nor to a really popular theater play, not even to a Coldplay concert. But I have found instead something miraculous; a front row seat to witness CREATION, to experience peace away from all the noise of our trivial lives, a front row seat to observe the perfection of nature that we neglect on a daily basis. A scene of colors mixed with the sounds of wind rushing through the orange grass, with a background of colliding blue hills that embodies millions of living organisms, the simplest of which is beyond our whole technological achievement. A scene that represent a tiny fraction of the universe around us. How can I not be in awe?"

Huge beasts stalked majestically through the streets of Norwich. Prehistoric birds flying overhead. A mythical world came alive.  This years Festival opened in awesome style with Invasion, a highly mobile  and highly exciting  street spectacle. Invasion created an all-enveloping experience, as prehistoric animals moved through the audience and animal voices sounded from every direction. The beasts, came from all sides, leaving people confused: should they follow or flee? But chaos was avoided by a magical song that attracts the animals and restored calm, leaving the crowds to go with the flow of the unique and enthralling event.  Large animals moved between the public. A mythical world came alive; animal sounds were heard everywhere. A dark figure appeared as a prehistoric bird flew overhead. The area was completely filled as all the creatures spread out, causing confusion among the people; should they run or follow? The chaos ended by a magical song that attracted the animals and calmed them!  Invasion - An unforgettable moving street spectacle that moves the crowd like a sea. People see impressive figures and forget the actors inside the costumes. All get carried away: this is a unique experience! Performed by Close-Act Theatre a professional company of stilt walkers, dancers, musicians, fire throwers and acrobats, training and rehearsing together on a regular basis. Close-Act also has a studio of costume designers, visual artists, graphic and industrial designers. Work-students from different colleges come to our studio often for an internship. Last but not least Close-Act has an office with fantastic people who maintain relations with both clients and performers. They are also involved in developing special concepts and scenarios and most of them combine the office work with performing or working in the studio. The different disciplines and backgrounds of all these people make for interesting interaction and a surprising mix when we are creating new performances. Leading forces and inspirators of Close-Act are artistic directors Hesther Melief and Tonny Aerts. From their brains the concepts for the performances originate and they give direction to all people until the performance reaches its final form. Close-Act was founded in 1991 and settled in a monumental farm in Tilburg in 2003. The actors and co-workers come from all over the Netherlands and Belgium. From the start Close-Act has been performing abroad. Mostly in Europe at first, but since the success of performances such as Malaya and the mobile acts Saurus and White Wings, Close-Act travels across the world. Close-Act is always on the move. The company aims on launching a new performance every two years. New mobile acts are created each year. Existing acts are constantly improved with new costumes, acting, dance and technical innovations. With Malaya Close-Act found a form that best suits their vision on Street Theatre. Instead of using a stage or a fenced-off playsite, the actors and mobile objects move between and above the crowd. This ultimate form of interactive street theatre has great impact on the audience. The big mobile objects and beautifully designed costumes are best suited for a large audience. Close-Act therefore performs mainly at street theatre festivals and large scaled events."

And so it was an beautiful experience to watch Mozart the owl take flight, glide and land with such amazing grace.   I was in awe as I watched the owl hurl itself forward from its perch.  With lightning speed it spread its wings to its full span, flapped & was instantly in flight.  That afternoon at Leeds Castle as I aimed the 70-200mm lens at the owl, I could not help but marvel at the ingenious design of mother nature.  And if I were to be the professor setting the project topic for post graduate aerodynamics engineering students, I could imagine their protests if I were to ask them to design a craft that mimics the owl.  Imagine this:  *  For greater lift and speed, wing span must be minimum 3 times the body length.   *  For greater ease of storage on aircraft carrier, wings must fold neatly such that its width or height does not exceed its length. *  And the killer requirement:  No runway.  Simply leap off from the flight deck, and land on the perch.  In this image, you see the wings near the highest most point of the flap.  In the next images, you can see  *  the wings near the lowest point of the flap;  *  the milliseconds before the owl lands on its perch - no runway! *  the owl midway thru folding its wings."

We saw the Kp Index numbers were going up, and we were hopeful we might catch the aurora here on Anglesey later that night. A few minutes later we saw a photo of the back of the camera of a friend which looked like an aurora. We skedaddled in the car as fast as we could, kids in tow,  and not really knowing if this was a photo he'd taken in Iceland a few days previously. As we arrived, Adrian ventured off into the darkness. So, the girls and I stood peering out to sea, not sure if we were seeing the Northern lights or plain old air glow and light pollution. When we closed the shutter, not daring to hope, there was an instant of awe as we gazed, open-mouthed, at the bright pinks and greens exposed  by that first 5 second literal shot in the dark. As our eyes grew accustomed to the light, we began to pick up the pale pinks and greens, and the long light pillars stretching down. It was a truly magical surprise, both in terms of venturing out on an impromptu shoot, and in taking that very first shot and marvelling at what was happening above us. A couple more back of camera shots. Hoping these will grow into good photos when I get them off the camera.  Update: sadly this is one of the 400 photos that I lost when my memory card failed. So glad I took this shot of the back of the camera. A wonderful memory of a wonder-filled night. Update 2: I found this shot in the photos that I still had. I recognised it by the dragon shape of the cloud in the middle. So pleased I didn't lose him. A dragon flying by made complete an almost entirely surreal event   Id love it if you could check out my new photography blog, Seeing the Gorilla. Thank you!"

At first, upon noticing this conical shape on the opposite side at the base, my wife and I thought that there was some sort of construction going on, thinking that the red object was some type of implement used as a cautionary warning; however, we then realized that it was actually far too large, relatively speaking, regarding such construction items.  When zooming in more, both with the mid range telescopic lens and the binoculars, we realized that it was a smaller lighthouse.   After sending the photos out to friends and relatives, one of our friends responded with some interesting links, which provide some great information on the adorable, historic lighthouse with a height of only 40 feet. Check out the links below:  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Red_Lighthouse  www.historichousetrust.org/item.php?i_id=24  www.northjersey.com/recreation/daytripping0901.html "

Situated about 150km north east of Seville and with a current population of just over 300,000,  Cordoba was founded by the Romans at the highest navigable point on the Guadalquivir River.  For that reason it became a port  of great importance, used for shipping Spanish olive oil, wine and wheat back to Ancient Rome. The Romans built the mighty bridge crossing the river, now called ""El Puente Romano"". But Cordoba's hour of greatest glory was when it became the capital of the Moorish kingdom of El-Andalus, and this was when work began on the Great Mosque, or ""Mezquita"", which  after several centuries of additions and enlargements  became one of the largest in all of Islam. When the city was reconquered by the Christians in 1236, the new rulers of the city were so awed by its beauty that they left it standing, building their cathedral in the midst of its rows of arches and columns, and creating the extraordinary church-mosque that we see today. As well as the unique mosque-cathedral, Cordoba's treasures include the Alcazar, or Fortress, built by the Christians in 1328; the Calahorra Fort, originally built by the Arabs, which guards the Roman Bridge, on the far side of the river from the Mezquita, and the ancient Jewish Synagogue, now a museum.  There are plenty more photos of Cordoba and other Spanish towns if you take a look at my 'Sets' page, www.flickr.com/photos/36623892@N00/sets/ - thank you."

What we found were a few schools of Rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), swimming upstream. What an awe-inspiring sight! At this time of year, these silvery fish swim from Neponset Estuary into less salty contributing creeks, to lay eggs at night. This occurs each spring, around this time. // Smelt populations have declined drastically over the years, due to water pollution and the construction of dams along their migration routes. Thus, the sight of hundreds of these migratory fish swimming up a Neponset stream is heartening! However, it appears that the smelt can't get past the point at which the stream has been enclosed in a tunnel under the road. If that culvert were modified and fish could get past, they could reach more habitat for spawning, upstream. The more smelt that successfully hatch from eggs, the better! // The dead fish along the edge of the brook may have been killed by raccoons searching out the female, egg-laden smelt, and letting go of the male fish, according to Brad Chase.

The Australian Garden expresses a new direction in the design of Botanic Gardens particularly utilising Australian plants based on creative landscape experiences rather than bio-region or taxonomy. The project aims to offer an insight into the greater potential of using Australian flora in interesting, provocative and delightful ways in a more experiential and interpretive  setting.  A primary design theme of the Australian Garden at Cranbourne is the exploration and expression of the evolving relationship between Australians and their landscape and flora. The garden expresses this tension between Australians reverence and sense of awe for the natural landscape, and their innate impulse to change it, to make it into a humanly contrived form, beautiful yet their own work.  The Australian Garden was designed by Adelaide-based Taylor Cullity Lethlean together with Melbournes Paul Thompson.  "

Not everyone will find this attractive, but I actually find it all the more remarkable for it.  Copious quantities of stained glass is visible in the windows and weirdly shaped apertures, but alas I was out of luck as it was all locked up. There was a notice directing people wishing access to the church to the priest's house behind it, but I could tell my efforts were in vain as my appeal to look inside was met with a puzzled frown and a suggestion that I come back for mass the following morning. He was perhaps busy which is fair enough, but for me living nearly 20 miles away returning wasn't so simple.   I wasn't overly keen on looking around after a service, the timings didn't suit my trains and it would be likely busy, so when I saw 'confessions' listed 11-12 Saturday mornings thought that might be a better bet. Turned up to find the church was open but with a few people (inc. the priest I'd met before, who I didn't think would be overly keen to see me loitering again) sitting or kneeling quietly inside, I realised it was now exposition of the Blessed Sacrament instead. A very awkward time to look around, I'd have to content myself with quietly keeping out of the way in the chapels at the back and get some pics of their windows at least, but this wasn't enough for one member of the flock who noticed me and glared in a 'How dare you enter our church!' kind of way! I retreated out of sight into the baptistery to sit and look at a fine abstract window, but he decided to come and stand staring aggressively opposite me and clearly wanted to start something, but the atmosphere of awed silence prevented this and he left, but he'd made his point, I knew I was not welcome in this church.  I left shortly afterwards myself feeling frustrated (for the second time, not having been able to view or record the full interior) and deeply uncomfortable. I was hoping to bump meet my would-be assailant outside, having mentally prepared some suitable Biblical quotes about Christian behaviour since he displayed so little of it, but it was  most likely just an all too common case of being judged guilty of whatever before proven innocent.   So to summarise, this is one of the most remarkable modern church buildings I've seen, but from my experiences also just about the most unwelcoming I've ever visited. I'm sure, with hindsight, staying after a mass would have been a far better choice after all, reception might have been different (certainly couldn't be worse)."

The tone is set : even the Beijing Olympics ceremony cant compete with the mass games organized by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). The show is held several times a week and welcomes tourists from all over the World, including the US, in one of the most isolated and despised country on earth. The well-called  mass games  are designed to emphasize group dynamics rather than individual performances as the supreme emblem of communism. Prepared by hundred of thousands performers all along the year, after their classes for the youngest of them, they are entirely dedicated to the NKs leader Kim Jong Il and his deceased father Kim Il Sung, considered as the  Eternal president  and  sun of the 21st century      In the surroundings of Pyongyang's May Day giant Stadium, two girls are running to perform for the Arirang show. They are already dressed in their gymnastic outfits, as well as some 100,000 others who participate to the performance. They all come to honour their self-proclaimed  dear leader  Kim Jong Il, after a very hard and gruelling training, since their earliest age. Yet, it has been many years that Kim Jong Il has not shown up, formally for business reasons. But officials now admit the western medias assertions of illness. Anyways, Kim Jong Il or not, the mass games are held every year in Pyongyang, as a means for the regime to show to the entire world the countrys strength and good shape. To reach this sole purpose, not less than 100,000 people are involved in a choreographed show of simultaneous dancing and gymnastics. Many symbols are displayed by thousands of trained athlets, whether they are adults or even children. Hand over their heart, the young pupils sing in chorus ""We are the happiest children in the world"", one of the famous propaganda songs in North Korea. Many dancers make movements either with ribbons or colourful flowers named  kimjonglias  after the leader Kim Jong Il. All along the show, a live band plays a ceremonious music.   On the background, some 20,000 young koreans sit on the terraces, facing the spectators. They flip coloured cards at a high speed to form a fresco of animated and detailed images, changing from one to another. Each time they turn the page to create a new giant picture, they cry out. It creates a awe-inspiring atmosphere, as the shout is mixed with the noise of thousands of pages turned at the same moment. The figures are stunning : to compose these images, 2000 children  are needed to make only one soldier, 20,000 for a north korean flag. Hiding a much more grim reality, the panels represent Pyongyang enlightened by night, wheat fields ready for harvest, scientists at work, atoms as symbols of the nuclear bomb and others for the reunification of two Koreas. One of the North Koreas myths (history according to them) is recounted by the means of a huge image made by thousands of children. It represents the two pistols reportedly used by Kim Il Sung, when he founded the Anti-Japanese Peoples Guerrilla Army in 1932. When the pistols appear, the audience applauses loudly. Among them, many soldiers attend the show as the ultimate award after years of good and faithful service.The thousands and thousands of boys and girls involved create a giant mass movement in the stadium which leaves the public stunned. These talented performers are used to that kind of performance: in North Korea they have to dance, sing, jump and spin around as many times as there are celebrations, always in praise of their leaders. There are mainly two sorts of shows. The first one is the classical artistic show, named ""Arirang"" after the famous korean folk song (whose story sometimes changes, but most often  recounts the legend of a disappointed woman who hopes that her lover will return to her metaphor of the break-up with South Korea). The second one is a more political show, which was untitled in 2008 ""Prosper our country"" and intended to show the countrys greatest achievements and its struggle against the foreign oppressors.  The show continues in the same way for one hour. Thereafter, the thousands of people present vanish in the dark and silent streets of Pyongyang, which contrast with the flood of lights and music in the stadium. Within the space of a few hours, it gives us a a strange feeling, between the real and unreal, of another universe both terrifying and fantastic.    Dans toute la ville, les publicits dArirang ( Grande reprsentation gymnastique et artistique de masse ,  Bienvenue  Pyongyang  etc.) mettent le profane en garde Entre aot et octobre, a lieu lune des plus grandes et impressionnantes reprsentations au monde. Le ton est donn : pas mme la crmonie des Jeux de Pkin ne peut rivaliser avec les mass games organiss par la Rpublique Dmocratique Populaire de Core (RDPC). Le spectacle se tient plusieurs fois par semaine et accueille des touristes du monde entier, y compris des Etats-Unis, dans lun des pays les plus isols et mpriss sur terre. Les biens nomms mass games ( mouvements de masse) sont conus pour mettre en avant les dynamiques de groupe plutt que les performances individuelles comme emblme suprme du communisme. Prpars par des centaines de milliers dartistes tout au long de lanne, aprs les cours pour les plus jeunes dentre eux, les jeux sont entirement ddis au leader de la Core du Nord, Kim Jong Il, et feu son pre Kim Il Sung, considr comme l  Eternel prsident  et  soleil du 21me sicle   Aux environs du Stade gant May Day de Pyongyang, deux filles courent pour participer au spectacle de Arirang. Elles sont dj en costume de gymnastique, tout comme quelque 100 000 autres qui participent  la reprsentation. Tous viennent pour honorer leur autoproclam  cher leader  Kim Jong Il, aprs un trs difficile et prouvant entranement, depuis leur plus jeune ge. Pourtant, cela fait plusieurs annes que Kim Jong Il ne sest pas montr, formellement pour des raisons professionnelles. Mais des officiels admettent les assertions des mdias occidentaux sur sa maladie. Quoi quil en soit, Kim Jong Il ou pas, les jeux de masse ont lieu chaque anne  Pyongyang, comme moyen pour le rgime de montrer au monde entier la puissance et bonne sant du pays. Pour atteindre ce seul but, pas moins de 100 000 personnes sont engages dans une chorgraphie de danses et gymnastiques synchronises. De nombreux symboles sont affichs par des milliers dathltes entrans, quil sagisse dadultes ou mme denfants. Main sur le cur, les jeunes lves chantent en chur  Nous sommes les enfants les plus heureux du monde , lune des chansons de propagande les plus connues en Core du Nord. De nombreux danseurs font des mouvements avec des rubans ou avec des fleurs colores appeles  kimjonglias , du nom du leader Kim Jong Il. Tout le long du spectacle, un orchestre joue une musique solennelle.   larrire-plan, quelque 20 000 jeunes corens sont assis sur les gradins, faisant face aux spectateurs. Ils retournent des cartes colores  une grande vitesse pour former une fresque dimages animes et dtailles, changeant de lune  lautre. Chaque fois quils tournent la page pour crer une nouvelle illustration, ils crient. Cela cre une atmosphre impressionnante, le cri tant ml avec le bruit de milliers de pages tournes au mme moment. Les chiffres sont stupfiants : pour composer ces images, 2000 enfants sont ncessaires pour faire un seul soldat, 20 000 pour un drapeau de la Core du Nord. Cachant une ralit bien plus dure, les panneaux reprsentent Pyongyang claire la nuit, des champs de bl prt  tre rcolt, des scientifiques au travail, des atomes comme symboles de la bombe nuclaire et dautres pour la runification des deux Cores. Lun des mythes de Core du Nord (ou histoire selon eux) est relat au moyen dune image gigantesque faite par des milliers denfants. Elle reprsente les deux pistolets que Kim Il Sung aurait utiliss quand il a fond larme de gurilla populaire anti-japonaise en 1932. Lorsque les deux pistolets apparaissent, le public applaudit bruyamment. Parmi eux, de nombreux soldats assistent au spectacle comme rcompense ultime aprs des annes de bons et loyaux services. Les milliers et milliers de garons et de filles participant crent un mouvement de masse gant dans le stade, qui laisse le public bahi. Ces artistes talentueux sont coutumiers de ce type de reprsentation : en Core du Nord ils doivent danser, chanter, sauter et virevolter autant de fois quil y a de clbrations, toujours  la gloire de leurs chefs. Il existe principalement deux sortes de spectacles. Le premier est le spectacle classique artistique, appel  Arirang  daprs la clbre chanson folklorique corenne (dont lhistoire quelques fois change, mais qui raconte le plus souvent la lgende dune femme due qui espre que son amant lui reviendra mtaphore de la sparation avec la Core du Sud). Le second est un spectacle plus politique, qui tait intitul en 2008  Que prospre notre pays  et qui tentait de montrer les plus grandes ralisations du pays et sa lutte contre les oppresseurs trangers.   Le spectacle continue de cette faon pendant une heure. Ensuite, les milliers de personnes prsentes disparaissent dans les rues sombres et silencieuses de Pyongyang, ce qui contraste avec le dluge de lumires et de musique dans le stade. En lespace de quelques heures, cela nous donne un trange sentiment, entre le rel et lirrel, dun autre univers  la fois terrifiant et fantastique.    Eric Lafforgue www.ericlafforgue.com "

Huge beasts stalked majestically through the streets of Norwich. Prehistoric birds flying overhead. A mythical world came alive.  This years Festival opened in awesome style with Invasion, a highly mobile  and highly exciting  street spectacle. Invasion created an all-enveloping experience, as prehistoric animals moved through the audience and animal voices sounded from every direction. The beasts, came from all sides, leaving people confused: should they follow or flee? But chaos was avoided by a magical song that attracts the animals and restored calm, leaving the crowds to go with the flow of the unique and enthralling event.  Large animals moved between the public. A mythical world came alive; animal sounds were heard everywhere. A dark figure appeared as a prehistoric bird flew overhead. The area was completely filled as all the creatures spread out, causing confusion among the people; should they run or follow? The chaos ended by a magical song that attracted the animals and calmed them!  Invasion - An unforgettable moving street spectacle that moves the crowd like a sea. People see impressive figures and forget the actors inside the costumes. All get carried away: this is a unique experience! Performed by Close-Act Theatre a professional company of stilt walkers, dancers, musicians, fire throwers and acrobats, training and rehearsing together on a regular basis. Close-Act also has a studio of costume designers, visual artists, graphic and industrial designers. Work-students from different colleges come to our studio often for an internship. Last but not least Close-Act has an office with fantastic people who maintain relations with both clients and performers. They are also involved in developing special concepts and scenarios and most of them combine the office work with performing or working in the studio. The different disciplines and backgrounds of all these people make for interesting interaction and a surprising mix when we are creating new performances. Leading forces and inspirators of Close-Act are artistic directors Hesther Melief and Tonny Aerts. From their brains the concepts for the performances originate and they give direction to all people until the performance reaches its final form. Close-Act was founded in 1991 and settled in a monumental farm in Tilburg in 2003. The actors and co-workers come from all over the Netherlands and Belgium. From the start Close-Act has been performing abroad. Mostly in Europe at first, but since the success of performances such as Malaya and the mobile acts Saurus and White Wings, Close-Act travels across the world. Close-Act is always on the move. The company aims on launching a new performance every two years. New mobile acts are created each year. Existing acts are constantly improved with new costumes, acting, dance and technical innovations. With Malaya Close-Act found a form that best suits their vision on Street Theatre. Instead of using a stage or a fenced-off playsite, the actors and mobile objects move between and above the crowd. This ultimate form of interactive street theatre has great impact on the audience. The big mobile objects and beautifully designed costumes are best suited for a large audience. Close-Act therefore performs mainly at street theatre festivals and large scaled events."

Having done a very early morning start at Liberty State Park on Christmas day of 2013, while thoroughly enjoying the awe inspiring experience along the waterfront walkway with one of the worlds greatest urban landscapes (and waterscape) in and around the New York Harbor, I decided to do the same again this year; however, given some prior obligations, it was the day after Christmas, instead.  Like the previous year, nary a soul besides me was out before sunrise, and it was not until about an hour after the sun first appeared that a group of visitors emerged.  So, I basically had the entire waterfront park to myself for a pretty good stretch of time. If you have never been there, it really is a sight to behold when one can see the majesty of the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island with its unique place in American history, and the recently completed Freedom Tower, standing above all as the new proud symbol of what every person aspires to possess . . . FREEDOM.  It took my wife and me quite a few years after the infamous, heart wrenching event of the fallen Twin Towers, simply known as 9-11.  If you go to our FLICKR albums, you will see the mid to latter construction stage of the Freedom Tower in photos under New York Skylines or the Meadowlands landscapes and such.   Initially, we both felt that nothing could ever replace or exude the same powerful presence as the original Twin Towers, and felt disappointment in the design of the Freedom Tower as it began to evolve from ground up, but when it reached its latter stages and the way the natural light over the course of any given day would play a significant role in its image, an overwhelming sense of admiration for the concept began to grow, and when finally completed, it all seemed to be a perfect visual symbol to the new landscape of New York Harbor.  As we used to feel driving to the City or passing by from the New Jersey side, a similar kind of pride is felt with this new, great landmark that has made such a significant impact on the psyche of our citizens.   Many of you have likely stopped reading this long narrative, but you can probably surmise that aforementioned pride in these comments.  Having personally seen the falling of the Twin Towers from work three miles away on that horrific weekday morning with all the confused and maddening reports being broadcasted on the radio and television news, it becomes an experience that is, indelibly, forever etched in my mind . . . So, that day is always present whenever I look toward the southern anchor of the Manhattan skyline, and I absolutely love how the Freedom Tower has not replaced, but serves as a natural extension of the Twin Towers and honors those who have lost their lives, accordingly. Looking farther north offers the Empire State Building and Chrysler Building, the two iconic skyscrapers that ruled the architectural world of construction beyond imagination in the early 1930s.  And the Goldman-Sachs Tower of Jersey City, on the New Jersey side of the Hudson River, can hold its own amongst the giants of the NY Harbor landmarks.  The captivating style of this particular modern design somehow compliments the glorious Manhattan skylinepractically blending in as part of a grand visual sweep from one side of the harbor to the other.  And furthermore, the famous Brooklyn Bridge can be seen in the distance between the southern end of Manhattan and the borough of Brooklyn, and to the far south, the Verrazano Bridge dominates the entry way to the great harbor that saw thousands upon thousands of aspiring immigrants who traveled the vast Atlantic Ocean, ultimately arriving in America, while taking their first step on our soil at Ellis Island, under the protective presence of Lady Liberty.   One historic reminder after another permeates the air, causing just about everyone to feel something truly special.  Even if visitors know little of the history here, it is nearly impossible not to be awe struck.    In closing, the two extreme ends of the waterfront park, the northern point and the South Lawn, offer monuments that are so powerful and captivating.  I am always taken by the Liberation Monument, which honors all of those who served our nation in the fight for freedom.  If any of you ever have the chance to visit LSP, please do take some time to genuinely appreciate this statue from all angles, for it almost comes to life.  The northern end of the park has the New Jersey EMPTY SKY 9-11 Memorial, which must be seen.  A surge of emotions will flood through your body as you stand at the site and gaze across to the East where the Twins once stood. Anyhow, I hope that this passage would serve as a motivating factor to visit Liberty State Park, if possible.  Regardless of the degree of personal meaning this may have, it is still a landscape that is well worth the trip . . . Nothing like it in the world. "

We are looking south. This is where the line to Miami splits off and makes the straight run to Auburndale. CSX has somehow figured it better to abandon this straight, flat, CTC controlled stretch in favor of the Vitis Sub which is like a Roller Coaster. I first heard of the pending abandonment in late 1988 but hoped it would still be in use by the time I got here in 1989. Nope!!! CSX had pulled the Rails already. I followed the trail of crossties south to Sumpterville and Center Hill before just giving up the Ghost. Some of the Signals were still lit, however, a really weird thing to see. Here I just scratched my Head in awe. All traffic now follows the track I am standing on...this is the former SAL at least as far as Owensboro. There it shifts to former ACL Rails, and ""S"" Line traffic eventually makes it back to Auburndale via the Vitis Sub and Lakeland. The abandonment resulted in the Amtrak ""Silver Star"" being rerouted in several places creating a ""Zig-Zag"" pattern that continues to this day. Eventually, the Silver Star was rerouted again to the A Line and no longer runs here. BUT...this has become the primary CSX freight route in Florida and many upgrades continue to transform the route into a major heavy-duty corrider. However, the upgrades are somewhat bittersweet when you consider what was once here...a straight run to Auburndale on very flat CTC controlled mainline. I visited this place in 2006 and you can barely see where the line turned off to the left. The Pole on the left with the short Crossarm was still there, but all the others were gone. CSX in Blunderville. I have heard several stories concerning the abandonment of this stretch...no Business...no Customers. OK, but it was still a straight shot to Auburndale. But it dosen't matter today. It is gone. Compare this shot to Fred Clark's Picture of the same exact spot in 1986. You will note the track I am standing on had jointed Rail at the time. Now it is welded!!! How I would love to see a Picture of a freight coming off the line before it was torn up!"

The Northern Lights is a common name for the Aurora Borealis (Polar Aurorae) in the Northern Hemisphere.  Auroras are caused by charged particles, mainly electrons and protons from the solar wind, entering the atmosphere from above causing ionisation and excitation of atmospheric constituents, and consequent optical emissions.  The green colour seen in this shot, the most common auroral colour, is caused by excited molecular oxygen.  However produced, the Aurora is simply beautiful.  Note: unlike many aurora shots, I have resisted the temptation to massively jazz up the images in post-processing so that the sky is full of garish colours. Very nice, but not realistic and not really what I actually saw.   "

Built in the 9th century during the reign of the Syailendra dynasty, the temples design in Gupta architecture reflects India's influence on the region, yet there are enough indigenous scenes and elements incorporated to make Borobudur uniquely Indonesian. This awe inspiring monument is truly a marvel. After a visit here you will understand why it is Indonesias most visited tourist attraction and a famous icon of Indonesias cultural heritage.   Located on the island of Java, the temple sits majestically on a hilltop overlooking lush green fields and distant hills. It covers an enormous area, measuring 123 x 123 meters. The monument is a marvel of design, decorated with 2,672 relief panels and 504 Buddha statues. The architecture and stonework of this temple has no equal. And it was built without using any kind of cement or mortar! The structure is like a set of massive interlocking Lego blocks held together without any glue.   The temple has remained strong even through ten centuries of neglect. It was rediscovered in 1815, buried under volcanic ash. In the 1970s the Indonesian Government and UNESCO worked together to restore Borobudur to its former majesty The restoration took eight years to complete and today Borobudur is one of Indonesia and the worlds most valuable treasures.   The temple is decorated with stone carvings in bas-relief representing images from the life of Buddha. Commentators claim that this is the largest and most complete ensemble of Buddhist reliefs in the world, unsurpassed in artistic merit.   This monument is both a shrine to the Lord Buddha and a place for Buddhist pilgrimage. The ten levels of the temple symbolize the three divisions of the religions cosmic system. As visitors begin their journey at the base of the temple, they make their way to the top of the monument through the three levels of Budhist cosmology, Kamadhatu (the world of desire), Rupadhatu (the world of forms) and Arupadhatu (the world of formlessness). As visitors walk to the top the monument guides the pilgrims past 1,460 narrative relief panels on the wall and the balustrades.   The whole monument itself resembles a giant stupa, but seen from above it forms a mandala. The great stupa at the top of the temple sits 40 meters above the ground. This main dome is surrounded by 72 Buddha statues seated inside perforated stupa.   Historians suggest that the name of Borobudur comes from the Sanskrit Vihara Buddha Uhr or the Buddhist monastery on the hill.

Built by a Venetian architect for Lord Onslow in the 1720s, the estate has been passed down through generations of this famous family.  Magnificent interiors are faithful to the period, featuring original stucco ceilings and marble fireplaces, the most impressive of which are in the awe-inspiring Marble Hall.  Left to The National Trust in 1956, the house was refurbished under the guidance of interior design legend John Fowler. Today the house contains a superb collection of 18th-century furniture, porcelain and textiles, much of which was acquired by the remarkable connoisseur Hannah Gubbay.  While the wider parkland is still in the hands of the Onslow family, you can still see seven acres of gardens that surround the house. These are home to a small parterre garden, the walled Dutch Garden and Hinemihi, a Maori meeting house brought back from New Zealand in 1892. "

Well . . . never could I have imagined the absolutely stunning array of colors and tones offered for viewing . . . The incredible purple shades before sunrise and the ensuing amazing ascending golden orb, which would cast a beautiful warm tone across the rivers surface had not been anticipated, and furthermore, walking up to the great overlook promenade in Weehawkins river front park offered a fabulous opportunity for photographing the distant Freedom Tower (soon to be completed) and the downtown supporting skyscrapers . . . along with the view of the Hudson River opening into Hudson Bay.  So much history could be told about that landscape/waterscape in years past. Finally, the morning ended for me with a surprising encounter with the 9-11-2001 River Front Monument, overlooking Manhattan.  It was certainly heartfelt, but awe inspiring at the same time.  The experience along the river certainly provides endless opportunities for great photography, and even if not taking photos, it is still great fun.  "

Communicating completely in a different language with a family you do no know very well could be tiring at times, but no matter how frustrated I got, I could just look out my window and every frustrating moment was behind me.

For instance, this is a concept about Venus taking a bath by the beach. Venus is the Roman Goddess that  encompassed love, beauty, sex, fertility and prosperity. As much as possible I wanted to portray her in that sense. Venus has been the popular subject in the art community all around Europe during the Renaissance period. She was always depicted in an erotic way and has been justified due to her being the goddess of sexuality. For me, her depiction from many great artist has always left me in awe. That someday I would create a series based on her divine beauty and make her the subject of my creations.   If you have noticed, my concepts lately have been around a body of water. Well it's because it's spring! Gone is the winter and say hello to sunshine and daisies! Plus, I really love concepts around water. For me, the water is a charming environment.

I dreaded the ladder on the way up and grew to dread it even more on the way down. The ladder itself iwasn't very difficult, but with a oversized top heavy pack weighing in at over 2/3rds my body weight it was a rather unnerving experience. On top of that the top of the ladder was taken out by a avalanche this past winter. Now the top rung is even with the ground, with only one support bar rising up less than a foot above ground level, with the other being a jagged corner (that's the one under Alanas left hand). To navigate off the ladder safetly without risking tipping over backwards I chose to crawl off the ladder and along the ground until I could find a rock to help me stand up. As it turned out this was the method of choice for most people I talked to. During my stay in the bugs I couldn't help but think about how hard and scary it was going to be to get back on the ladder on the descent. The way down was pretty much as bad as I imagined it would be, luckily I had some help by fellow hikers who helped hold the weight of my pack while I sketickly mounted the ladder. I got down safetly, but I'm sure hoping they fix that ladder for my trip next year.  The Bugaboos - August 12-18, 2012  Living in Squamish I am very lucky to be surrounded by excellent rock to train my technical climbing skills as well as many great peaks for scrambling. But, until last week I had never had the opportunity to combine the two skills I've been developing for years. That all changed when a friend invited me to be her partner on the yearly trip my friend group takes. Two months after the invitiation, a partner swap, and a week of careful packing and preparation I actually found myself driving east about to embark on what would be the greatest adventure of my life to date.   The moment I arrived at basecamp my lofty climbing aspiration were downgraded to starting with a 4th class route and going from there. I received tons of advice from friends that had been going for several years, but still nothing could have prepared me for the reality of being there. The ascent to Applebee basecamp, the scale of the spires, the difficulty of the glaciers, and the exposure did not translate well to maps and photos I found myself in awe and terror. Every single obstacle I encountered was more physically and mentally demanding that I could have expected.   Even though we were with a large group of friends, we were on our own when we headed out for the day and often learning as we went. As a result we learned many lessons the hard way, including when to put crampons on, when to switch into rock shoes, how hard preventing rockfall can be, and all the ways rappelling can go wrong.   It was both the single most terrifying and rewarding experience of my life. Never did I expect to learn so much in a week, or do so little actual climbing. Instead it was a wild ride of alpine obstacles, and a truly life changing experience shared with great friends old and new.   A brief summary of my adventure:  Aug 12 - Hike into Applebee base camp with 80+lbs pack full of climbing, camping, and glacier gear as well as 7 days of food, and clothes for everything from -10 to +30 degrees celcius rain and shine. Aug 13 - Eastpost spire, combination of Northeast and Northwest ridges. Aug 14 - Crescent Spire, W ridge. - Rained off first attempt, after self arresting and improv. anchor construction. Aug 15 - Crescent Spire, W ridge - Successful ascent followed by rappelling disaster involving ditching a rope that was later recovered Aug 16 - Pigeon Spire, W ridge - Got 30m up route then turned back to save terror management skills for descent back down the Bugaboo-Snowpatch col Aug 17 - Eastpost spire again and bathing in the tarn Aug 18 - Hike out and long drive home  Please feel free to contact me with any questions regarding my experience.  Photos from this trip were taken with a combination of my Nikon D7000, Olympus uT8000 & GoPro HD2"

The artist worked collaboratively with the architectural firm Hanna/Olin on the overall design of the park, including the pavement design, water wall, entryway, landscaping, amenities and sculptural elements at the south end of the park.  The monolith sculptures there also have been utilized for many things over the years; though for Street Performers, they make an ideal impromptu stage, such as this Cyr Wheel performer, who spent all day there recently performing amazing feats inside of the wheel as he raised funds to send him to the circus.  The Cyr Wheel was created by Daniel Cyr, Cirque Eloize Co-Founder, and the giant hula hoop-like device allows circus performers to execute a virtual infinite number of awe-inspiring acrobatic routines.

Standing here with the light mist and the roar of the water being squeezed into the crevice just below was simply awe inspiring best water in the world!   ""Gullfoss (""Golden Falls"") is a waterfall located in the canyon of Hvt river in southwest Iceland.   The wide Hvt rushes southward. About a kilometre above the falls it turns sharply to the right and flows down into a wide curved three-step ""staircase"" and then abruptly plunges in two stages (11 m and 21 m) into a crevice 32 m (105 ft) deep. The crevice, about 20 m (60 ft) wide, and 2.5 km in length, extends perpendicular to the flow of the river.   The average amount of water running over this waterfall is 140 m/s in the summertime and 80 m/s in the wintertime. The highest flood measured was 2000 m/s. ----"

I don't know anyone who witnessed this fledging, so I don't know if it took place in the daytime or at night.  Last year at this time, a number of us were so lucky to be standing there when the oldest flew.  It was starting to get dark and we were all holding our breath and hoping the new fledgling would make it to the tree - which it did, but low down on the tree trunk, not a branch.  Not one single person took any photos, we were just so in awe at witnessing the event.  Those are the best moments in nature, when getting a photo isn't the most important thing!  The weather forecast for today was rain and snow, so I decided to not go on a birding outing east if the city.  Guess what - the sun was shining when I got up!  I've lost count of how may trips I didn't go on this winter because bad weather was forecast and instead, the sun was shining.  I would have had to drive right across the city to the meeting place, too, which I never like doing.  "

Having done a very early morning start at Liberty State Park on Christmas day of 2013, while thoroughly enjoying the awe inspiring experience along the waterfront walkway with one of the worlds greatest urban landscapes (and waterscape) in and around the New York Harbor, I decided to do the same again this year; however, given some prior obligations, it was the day after Christmas, instead.  Like the previous year, nary a soul besides me was out before sunrise, and it was not until about an hour after the sun first appeared that a group of visitors emerged.  So, I basically had the entire waterfront park to myself for a pretty good stretch of time. If you have never been there, it really is a sight to behold when one can see the majesty of the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island with its unique place in American history, and the recently completed Freedom Tower, standing above all as the new proud symbol of what every person aspires to possess . . . FREEDOM.  It took my wife and me quite a few years after the infamous, heart wrenching event of the fallen Twin Towers, simply known as 9-11.  If you go to our FLICKR albums, you will see the mid to latter construction stage of the Freedom Tower in photos under New York Skylines or the Meadowlands landscapes and such.   Initially, we both felt that nothing could ever replace or exude the same powerful presence as the original Twin Towers, and felt disappointment in the design of the Freedom Tower as it began to evolve from ground up, but when it reached its latter stages and the way the natural light over the course of any given day would play a significant role in its image, an overwhelming sense of admiration for the concept began to grow, and when finally completed, it all seemed to be a perfect visual symbol to the new landscape of New York Harbor.  As we used to feel driving to the City or passing by from the New Jersey side, a similar kind of pride is felt with this new, great landmark that has made such a significant impact on the psyche of our citizens.   Many of you have likely stopped reading this long narrative, but you can probably surmise that aforementioned pride in these comments.  Having personally seen the falling of the Twin Towers from work three miles away on that horrific weekday morning with all the confused and maddening reports being broadcasted on the radio and television news, it becomes an experience that is, indelibly, forever etched in my mind . . . So, that day is always present whenever I look toward the southern anchor of the Manhattan skyline, and I absolutely love how the Freedom Tower has not replaced, but serves as a natural extension of the Twin Towers and honors those who have lost their lives, accordingly. Looking farther north offers the Empire State Building and Chrysler Building, the two iconic skyscrapers that ruled the architectural world of construction beyond imagination in the early 1930s.  And the Goldman-Sachs Tower of Jersey City, on the New Jersey side of the Hudson River, can hold its own amongst the giants of the NY Harbor landmarks.  The captivating style of this particular modern design somehow compliments the glorious Manhattan skylinepractically blending in as part of a grand visual sweep from one side of the harbor to the other.  And furthermore, the famous Brooklyn Bridge can be seen in the distance between the southern end of Manhattan and the borough of Brooklyn, and to the far south, the Verrazano Bridge dominates the entry way to the great harbor that saw thousands upon thousands of aspiring immigrants who traveled the vast Atlantic Ocean, ultimately arriving in America, while taking their first step on our soil at Ellis Island, under the protective presence of Lady Liberty.   One historic reminder after another permeates the air, causing just about everyone to feel something truly special.  Even if visitors know little of the history here, it is nearly impossible not to be awe struck.    In closing, the two extreme ends of the waterfront park, the northern point and the South Lawn, offer monuments that are so powerful and captivating.  I am always taken by the Liberation Monument, which honors all of those who served our nation in the fight for freedom.  If any of you ever have the chance to visit LSP, please do take some time to genuinely appreciate this statue from all angles, for it almost comes to life.  The northern end of the park has the New Jersey EMPTY SKY 9-11 Memorial, which must be seen.  A surge of emotions will flood through your body as you stand at the site and gaze across to the East where the Twins once stood. Anyhow, I hope that this passage would serve as a motivating factor to visit Liberty State Park, if possible.  Regardless of the degree of personal meaning this may have, it is still a landscape that is well worth the trip . . . Nothing like it in the world. "

Gliding past Jupiter at the turn of the millennium, the Cassini spacecraft captured this awe inspiring view of active Io with the largest gas giant as a backdrop, offering a stunning demonstration of the ruling planet's relative size. Although in the above picture Io appears to be located just in front of the swirling Jovian clouds, Io hurtles around its orbit once every 42 hours at a distance of 420,000 kilometers or so from the center of Jupiter. That puts Io nearly 350,000 kilometers above Jupiter's cloud tops, roughly equivalent to the distance between Earth and Moon.

Situated about 150km north east of Seville and with a current population of just over 300,000,  Cordoba was founded by the Romans at the highest navigable point on the Guadalquivir River.  For that reason it became a port  of great importance, used for shipping Spanish olive oil, wine and wheat back to Ancient Rome. The Romans built the mighty bridge crossing the river, now called ""El Puente Romano"". But Cordoba's hour of greatest glory was when it became the capital of the Moorish kingdom of El-Andalus, and this was when work began on the Great Mosque, or ""Mezquita"", which  after several centuries of additions and enlargements  became one of the largest in all of Islam. When the city was reconquered by the Christians in 1236, the new rulers of the city were so awed by its beauty that they left it standing, building their cathedral in the midst of its rows of arches and columns, and creating the extraordinary church-mosque that we see today. As well as the unique mosque-cathedral, Cordoba's treasures include the Alcazar, or Fortress, built by the Christians in 1328; the Calahorra Fort, originally built by the Arabs, which guards the Roman Bridge, on the far side of the river from the Mezquita, and the ancient Jewish Synagogue, now a museum.

It depicts a parallel universe in which the medieval architecture of Yorkshire was built in Iraq! I call it ""The Shire of Kurdistan"".  The landscape seen in this shot faces northeast towards Soran, a remote isolated city close to the Iranian border. Its perimiter is guarded on one side by the Canyons of Rawanduz, and on the opposite side the towering land mass of Zozik Mountian rises up to touch the sky. It's the most magical and awe inspiring place I've ever visited, so this epic scene felt appropriate for a bit of creative editing.  All of the mysterious ruined structures in the foreground of this view are buildings located in various parts of Yorkshire and its neighbouring counties. They may be half a world away from Rawanduz, but the stunning medieval architecture of northern England sits surprisingly well in this unlikely setting.  Hidden away in various parts of the image are Sheriff Hutton, Fountains Abbey, the Bramhope Tunnel, Barden Bridge, Ribblehead Viaduct, Swinton Park and the Lindisfarne Lime Kilns. Check it out in high resolution and see if you can spot any fun details!  To view some more realistic photographs from the beautiful land of Kurdistan, click here to browse a full image set."

Access to the Castle is sometimes restricted by higher-than-usual levels of water in the Loch, at which times the site effectively becomes a temporary island.  It was the ancestral home of the Campbells of Glen Orchy, who later became the Earls of Breadalbane also known as the Breadalbane family branch, of the Clan Campbell. The earliest construction on the castle was the towerhouse and Laich Hall (looks onto Loch Awe).

At the centre of the square is a four-thousand-year-old Egyptian obelisk, erected at the current site in 1568. Gian Lorenzo Bernini designed the square almost 100 years later, including the massive Tuscan colonnades, four columns deep, which embrace visitors in ""the maternal arms of Mother Church."" A granite fountain constructed by Bernini in 1675 matches another fountain designed by Carlo Maderno dating to 1613. The open space which lies before the basilica was redesigned by Gian Lorenzo Bernini from 1656 to 1667, under the direction of Pope Alexander VII, as an appropriate forecourt, designed ""so that the greatest number of people could see the Pope give his blessing, either from the middle of the faade of the church or from a window in the Vatican Palace"" (Norwich 1975 p 175). Bernini had been working on the interior of St. Peter's for decades; now he gave order to the space with his renowned colonnades, using the Tuscan form of Doric, the simplest order in the classical vocabulary, not to compete with the palace-like faade by Carlo Maderno, but he employed it on an unprecedented colossal scale to suit the space and evoke a sense of awe.  There were many constraints from existing structures. The massed accretions of the Vatican Palace crowded the space to the right of the basilica's faade; the structures needed to be masked without obscuring the papal apartments. The obelisk marked a centre, and a granite fountain by Carlo Maderno stood to one side: Bernini made the fountain appear to be one of the foci of the ovato tondo embraced by his colonnades and eventually matched it on the other side, in 1675, just five years before his death. The trapezoidal shape of the piazza, which creates a heightened perspective for a visitor leaving the basilica and has been praised as a masterstroke of Baroque theater, is largely a product of site constraint"

The Rckenfigur, or the back figure, is a term that came to be during the romantic period, where nature was idealised and worshiped by many artists of the time. The Rckenfigur symbolises the small human presence amid the expansive natural landscapes. It creates a sense of awe towards the natural scene, and a sense of mystery towards what the person is feeling or thinking. This is what I wanted to achieve in this series. The figure encourages you as a viewer to place yourself in his position, and to reflect over the nature perceived by humans."

This was shot in the morning at about 7am in West Kalimantan, Borneo. I was there for a mission trip with some friends. We had arrived after a grueling 12h bus ride, grateful for the chance to escape from the stressful pace of urban life and to do something meaningful for people in need. It had stormed the day before, and the night sky was concealed by thick cloud cover and fog. To be honest, nobody expected a nice sunrise. I had spotted the beginnings of a rainbow soon after the sun came up, but it was nothing spectacular. The clouds were still thick and a dull grey, washing out any blue in the sky. All that we could make out from the rainbow was a tiny arc at one corner of the scene, and I decided that it wasn't worth the memory space and battery life to capture the scene then.  However, after breakfast, a friend came shouting for me, ""You've got to see this""!  So I did. And that one glimpse was enough to convince me to sprint back towards my room to grab my wide-angle lens. The rainbow was stretched across the landscape in its full glory. Truly it was something special, something I knew not everyone got to see in a lifetime.  I am proud to say that this turned out to be one of my favorite pictures. The double rainbow stretches across a vast stretch of hilly primary forest, the three crosses at the bottom frame are symbolic of Christianity, the faith of the village we were helping out in, adding a spiritual feel to the photograph. The clouds were fluffy and neatly divided into 2 balanced parts, and they also formed nice lead-in lines from the top corners, adding depth to the photograph. The sun was still low in the sky, and almost right behind me, revealing interesting textures of the hilly landscape. The exposure was also much more manageable with the sun out of the composition, and the skies were more saturated with blue. The blue sky peeked through the cloud cover just enough to add drama, but not too much as to distract from the delicate hues of the rainbow.  Indeed, I was in awe of the spectacular sight before me - a reminder of what a wonderful world we live in, and how blessed we all are. I am very thankful for the chance to witness and capture that moment.  My New Facebook Page   All rights reserved. Use without permission is illegal."

The locals there find it comical when others marvel at the rainbows...its a common occurrence in Monteverde...with clear skies and rainbows galore...it set the pace for my descending trip from the cloud forest. La Fortuna's landscape is dominated by Volcn Arenal. I was told 80% of people who visit La Fortuna actually get to see the full view of the volcano as there are too many clouds. I was fotunate to be able to see the whole thing and wow what a sight. If you havent seen a volcano as I hadn't, it is awe inspiring, such a massive feature in the landscape. After sleeping a night, the next day I hiked around the Volcano and got to see a nice view of the valley and Lake. Afterwards in the evening, I went to a natural hotspring river where the water was a pleasantly hot temperature and relaxed."

With a couple horn chirps and a cheer from the crowd which sounded similar to the cheer at a sporting event it was clear that the CP's Holiday Train was here.  I would estimate that there was easily 1000+ people here throughout the course of the train's stop here.  After getting a couple dozen shots of the train with varying camera settings I made my way back to the car where I'd then drive to Newport and watch the train go through at track speed.  I would then overtake the train at EAST OAKLAND as it came to a stop there.  The huge gawker slowdown and brake lights from all of the cars on HWY 61 was interesting as I'm sure people unfamiliar with what they were seeing were totally awe struck.

Furthermore, a self-guided tour is available for those who would like to see the warm, cozy rooms throughout.  The duPonts did not adorn the interior with the most extravagant of furnishings, but rather with a more comfortable and practical design, relating to the common personnoting pretentious, by any means. We would like to share our experience of the visit to Longwood Gardens 2014 Christmas Spectacular (the main theme this year is BIRDS).  The festivities begin on Thanksgiving Day and continues through the end of the first week of 2015.  In recent years, we have found that it works perfectly for us to go on Thanksgiving Day, for we would celebrate TG early and afterward.  This allows an opening day attendance at Longwood, where the crowd is significantly less than during the peak weekend days.  There will be a good number of photos to view, and for the most part, presented in correct sequence.  Please check out our ALBUMS titled LONGWOOD GARDENS of Kennett Square, PA and/or CHRISTMAS SCENES for a better flow in exploring the photos, since the continuity is lost when uploading into FLICKR while many others are doing the same, thus, having a variety of shots mixed in between the ones representing our visit on this day.    The wide variety of flowers and plants at Longwood Gardens are absolutely stunning in all stages and species . . . truly a Garden of Eden for anyone with a deep passion for these gifts of nature.  The annual Longwood Gardens Christmas never fails to awe the visitors with one spectacular display after another.  Whether these are in the magnificently elegant grand Conservatory, or outdoors within the over 1,000 acres of fabulous grounds, each and every thing is meticulously planned and designed, always arriving at some fresh ideas and/or concepts, while also maintaining the traditionally classic holiday floral and lighting appointments throughout.  Given that the main theme for the 2014 holiday season is BIRDS, this can be seen in such spectacularly tasteful fashion throughout the displays of the vast indoor landscape.  From the moment one enters the architectural marvel of the Conservatory, whether through the main Orangery or the East Conservatory, an awe inspiring view awaits. "

The tone is set : even the Beijing Olympics ceremony cant compete with the mass games organized by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). The show is held several times a week and welcomes tourists from all over the World, including the US, in one of the most isolated and despised country on earth. The well-called  mass games  are designed to emphasize group dynamics rather than individual performances as the supreme emblem of communism. Prepared by hundred of thousands performers all along the year, after their classes for the youngest of them, they are entirely dedicated to the NKs leader Kim Jong Il and his deceased father Kim Il Sung, considered as the  Eternal president  and  sun of the 21st century      In the surroundings of Pyongyang's May Day giant Stadium, two girls are running to perform for the Arirang show. They are already dressed in their gymnastic outfits, as well as some 100,000 others who participate to the performance. They all come to honour their self-proclaimed  dear leader  Kim Jong Il, after a very hard and gruelling training, since their earliest age. Yet, it has been many years that Kim Jong Il has not shown up, formally for business reasons. But officials now admit the western medias assertions of illness. Anyways, Kim Jong Il or not, the mass games are held every year in Pyongyang, as a means for the regime to show to the entire world the countrys strength and good shape. To reach this sole purpose, not less than 100,000 people are involved in a choreographed show of simultaneous dancing and gymnastics. Many symbols are displayed by thousands of trained athlets, whether they are adults or even children. Hand over their heart, the young pupils sing in chorus ""We are the happiest children in the world"", one of the famous propaganda songs in North Korea. Many dancers make movements either with ribbons or colourful flowers named  kimjonglias  after the leader Kim Jong Il. All along the show, a live band plays a ceremonious music.   On the background, some 20,000 young koreans sit on the terraces, facing the spectators. They flip coloured cards at a high speed to form a fresco of animated and detailed images, changing from one to another. Each time they turn the page to create a new giant picture, they cry out. It creates a awe-inspiring atmosphere, as the shout is mixed with the noise of thousands of pages turned at the same moment. The figures are stunning : to compose these images, 2000 children  are needed to make only one soldier, 20,000 for a north korean flag. Hiding a much more grim reality, the panels represent Pyongyang enlightened by night, wheat fields ready for harvest, scientists at work, atoms as symbols of the nuclear bomb and others for the reunification of two Koreas. One of the North Koreas myths (history according to them) is recounted by the means of a huge image made by thousands of children. It represents the two pistols reportedly used by Kim Il Sung, when he founded the Anti-Japanese Peoples Guerrilla Army in 1932. When the pistols appear, the audience applauses loudly. Among them, many soldiers attend the show as the ultimate award after years of good and faithful service.The thousands and thousands of boys and girls involved create a giant mass movement in the stadium which leaves the public stunned. These talented performers are used to that kind of performance: in North Korea they have to dance, sing, jump and spin around as many times as there are celebrations, always in praise of their leaders. There are mainly two sorts of shows. The first one is the classical artistic show, named ""Arirang"" after the famous korean folk song (whose story sometimes changes, but most often  recounts the legend of a disappointed woman who hopes that her lover will return to her metaphor of the break-up with South Korea). The second one is a more political show, which was untitled in 2008 ""Prosper our country"" and intended to show the countrys greatest achievements and its struggle against the foreign oppressors.  The show continues in the same way for one hour. Thereafter, the thousands of people present vanish in the dark and silent streets of Pyongyang, which contrast with the flood of lights and music in the stadium. Within the space of a few hours, it gives us a a strange feeling, between the real and unreal, of another universe both terrifying and fantastic.    Dans toute la ville, les publicits dArirang ( Grande reprsentation gymnastique et artistique de masse ,  Bienvenue  Pyongyang  etc.) mettent le profane en garde Entre aot et octobre, a lieu lune des plus grandes et impressionnantes reprsentations au monde. Le ton est donn : pas mme la crmonie des Jeux de Pkin ne peut rivaliser avec les mass games organiss par la Rpublique Dmocratique Populaire de Core (RDPC). Le spectacle se tient plusieurs fois par semaine et accueille des touristes du monde entier, y compris des Etats-Unis, dans lun des pays les plus isols et mpriss sur terre. Les biens nomms mass games ( mouvements de masse) sont conus pour mettre en avant les dynamiques de groupe plutt que les performances individuelles comme emblme suprme du communisme. Prpars par des centaines de milliers dartistes tout au long de lanne, aprs les cours pour les plus jeunes dentre eux, les jeux sont entirement ddis au leader de la Core du Nord, Kim Jong Il, et feu son pre Kim Il Sung, considr comme l  Eternel prsident  et  soleil du 21me sicle   Aux environs du Stade gant May Day de Pyongyang, deux filles courent pour participer au spectacle de Arirang. Elles sont dj en costume de gymnastique, tout comme quelque 100 000 autres qui participent  la reprsentation. Tous viennent pour honorer leur autoproclam  cher leader  Kim Jong Il, aprs un trs difficile et prouvant entranement, depuis leur plus jeune ge. Pourtant, cela fait plusieurs annes que Kim Jong Il ne sest pas montr, formellement pour des raisons professionnelles. Mais des officiels admettent les assertions des mdias occidentaux sur sa maladie. Quoi quil en soit, Kim Jong Il ou pas, les jeux de masse ont lieu chaque anne  Pyongyang, comme moyen pour le rgime de montrer au monde entier la puissance et bonne sant du pays. Pour atteindre ce seul but, pas moins de 100 000 personnes sont engages dans une chorgraphie de danses et gymnastiques synchronises. De nombreux symboles sont affichs par des milliers dathltes entrans, quil sagisse dadultes ou mme denfants. Main sur le cur, les jeunes lves chantent en chur  Nous sommes les enfants les plus heureux du monde , lune des chansons de propagande les plus connues en Core du Nord. De nombreux danseurs font des mouvements avec des rubans ou avec des fleurs colores appeles  kimjonglias , du nom du leader Kim Jong Il. Tout le long du spectacle, un orchestre joue une musique solennelle.   larrire-plan, quelque 20 000 jeunes corens sont assis sur les gradins, faisant face aux spectateurs. Ils retournent des cartes colores  une grande vitesse pour former une fresque dimages animes et dtailles, changeant de lune  lautre. Chaque fois quils tournent la page pour crer une nouvelle illustration, ils crient. Cela cre une atmosphre impressionnante, le cri tant ml avec le bruit de milliers de pages tournes au mme moment. Les chiffres sont stupfiants : pour composer ces images, 2000 enfants sont ncessaires pour faire un seul soldat, 20 000 pour un drapeau de la Core du Nord. Cachant une ralit bien plus dure, les panneaux reprsentent Pyongyang claire la nuit, des champs de bl prt  tre rcolt, des scientifiques au travail, des atomes comme symboles de la bombe nuclaire et dautres pour la runification des deux Cores. Lun des mythes de Core du Nord (ou histoire selon eux) est relat au moyen dune image gigantesque faite par des milliers denfants. Elle reprsente les deux pistolets que Kim Il Sung aurait utiliss quand il a fond larme de gurilla populaire anti-japonaise en 1932. Lorsque les deux pistolets apparaissent, le public applaudit bruyamment. Parmi eux, de nombreux soldats assistent au spectacle comme rcompense ultime aprs des annes de bons et loyaux services. Les milliers et milliers de garons et de filles participant crent un mouvement de masse gant dans le stade, qui laisse le public bahi. Ces artistes talentueux sont coutumiers de ce type de reprsentation : en Core du Nord ils doivent danser, chanter, sauter et virevolter autant de fois quil y a de clbrations, toujours  la gloire de leurs chefs. Il existe principalement deux sortes de spectacles. Le premier est le spectacle classique artistique, appel  Arirang  daprs la clbre chanson folklorique corenne (dont lhistoire quelques fois change, mais qui raconte le plus souvent la lgende dune femme due qui espre que son amant lui reviendra mtaphore de la sparation avec la Core du Sud). Le second est un spectacle plus politique, qui tait intitul en 2008  Que prospre notre pays  et qui tentait de montrer les plus grandes ralisations du pays et sa lutte contre les oppresseurs trangers.   Le spectacle continue de cette faon pendant une heure. Ensuite, les milliers de personnes prsentes disparaissent dans les rues sombres et silencieuses de Pyongyang, ce qui contraste avec le dluge de lumires et de musique dans le stade. En lespace de quelques heures, cela nous donne un trange sentiment, entre le rel et lirrel, dun autre univers  la fois terrifiant et fantastique.    Eric Lafforgue www.ericlafforgue.com "

St Peter and St Paul, East Harling, Norfolk  With its aisles, clerestory, porch and chancel, St Peter and St Paul is a textbook example of its century, although there are a number of curiosities that add even more interest. The vestry on the north side of the chancel, for example, which was once a shrine chapel, retains its image niche on its eastern face. And there are more image niches, these with elaborate foliage pedestals, in the buttresses of the tower; everything is topped off by a lead and timber fleche which was apparently the model for the one at St Peter Mancroft in Norwich, a church which has several features in common with this one.  The tower is a delight, the buttressing and pinnacles exactly in proportion to make it appear to rise like a fairy castle from the ground. The south porch, by contrast, is, despite its flushwork, rather austere, a result of its rebuilding early in the 19th century before the ecclesiological movement took hold. All in all, this is as good as 15th century rebuilding gets, the money coming thanks to Anne Harling having no less than three husbands who all wanted to spend as little time in purgatory as possible.  You step down into a wide space which, on a dull day, can be rather gloomy. Although inevitably heavily restored by the Victorians, St Peter and St Paul does not have that depressingly anonymous urban feel you so often find in churches of this size. This is partly because the beautiful parclose screen in the south aisle partitions off so much space, creating a sense of rooms within rooms, altering the way your eyes are inevitably drawn to the east. The rood screen must have been vast here; its dado survives at the west end, a deeply traceried affair with its features presented in carving rather than painting.  When the rood screen was in its proper place, to move from the nave into the chancel must have been like stepping from darkness into light. This is because of the feature that makes East Harling famous, the vast east window with its 15th century glass. After St Peter Mancroft it is the best collection in Norfolk. Unusually, the provenance of the glass is fairly well-documented: we can be fairly certain that it came from this church originally. Still present after the Reformation, it was removed by the Harling family to the Hall in the early 17th century. They may have been Laudians wanting to preserve it from the intentions of the puritans, or merely thought it would look nice in their dining hall; whatever, we know that shortly before Francis Blomefield visited here in the 1730s it was returned to the church and set in its present configuration.  In 1939, when war threatened, it was removed again, being reset just before Cautley visited in the early 1950s. There are parts of at least three sequences here, two of which were almost certainly in the east window originally, and one which almost certainly wasn't.  Essentially, the window contains two rosary sequences; the Joyful Mysteries of the Blessed Virgin, which include the Annunciation, the Nativity and the Assumption, and the Sorrowful Mysteries of the Blessed Virgin, which include the Crucifixion and the Deposition. However, this is open to interpretation, as we shall see. There is also the figure of St Mary Magdalene, which may once have been associated with a nave altar, and would have been located in a window there.  The five lights contain four rows of panels, making twenty altogether.  Top row: I. Annunciation: Mary at her prayer desk. Gabriel, crowned and haloed, with a sceptre of lilies, kneels in supplication. II. Visitation: Elizabeth, hooded to show her age, places her hand on Mary's pregnant belly. III. Nativity: Two midwives look on. The infant in the manger is rayed; a horned cow gazes in awe. IV. Adoration of the Shepherds: One holds a lamb, one plays pipes. A third appears to offer a fleece. V. Adoration of the Magi: Two of the wise men gauge each others' reactions as the third offers his gift.  Second row: VI: collection of fragments. VII: Presentation in the Temple: Joseph carries the doves, Mary offers the child to Simeon. Anna is not shown. VIII: The Finding in the Temple: Head covered, Mary bursts in among the men to find her son teaching. IX: The Wedding at Canaa: Christ, seated at the top table, blesses a chicken and a ham. Mary directs the servant. X: collection of fragments.  Third row: XI: Mary of Magdala: Mary holds her long hair ready to anoint Christ's feet. Probably not from this window originally. XII: The Betrayal at Gethsemane: Judas kisses Christ; Peter cuts off the ear of the high priest's servant. XIII: Crucifixion: Mary swoons in John's arms. XIV: Deposition from the cross: The pieta. Tears spring from Mary's eyes. XV: Assumption of the Blessed Virgin: Mary is assumed bodily into heaven.  Bottom row: XVI: Donor: Probably Robert Wingfield, second husband of Anne Harling. XVII: Resurrection: Christ steps fully clothed from the tomb. Unusually, the soldiers are awake. XVIII: Ascension of Christ: Mary, surrounded by disciples, watches as her son ascends to heaven. XIX: Descent of the Holy Spirit: Mary, surrounded by disciples, receives the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. XX: Donor: Probably William Chamberlain, first husband of Anne Harling.  Nowadays, we tend to think of the rosary as consisting of three sequences of five mysteries each, but in the late middle ages things were much more flexible, and rosary sequences often consisted of seven mysteries. The Glorious Mysteries sequence, of which the Assumption is now a part, is a later development, and the two adorations shown here are subsumed into a single mystery. There are a couple of images here that don't quite fit; the Wedding at Canaa is obviously a Marian text, and yet is not traditionally a rosary subject. Similarly the Betrayal, the only one of the images not to feature Mary. I wonder if what we have here are parts of two separate sequences, a Marian sequence of mysteries (I-V, VII-IX, XV), and a Passion sequence (XII-XIV, XVII-XIX). They are both clearly the work of the same workshop, and Mary is always shown with the same face and dress, but this would not preclude them from being two sequences.  Why were they here at all? We need to get away from thinking of such things as a 'poor man's bible', the need for which was superseded at the Reformation. These were devotional objects, designed to be used as meditations while praying and saying the rosary. They were created in the 15th century, a time when the mind of the Church was fiercely concentrated on asserting orthodox Catholic doctrine in the face of local superstitions and abuses. As such, they were anathema to the reformers, and were later elsewhere destroyed for being superstitious, not for being superfluous. An 18th century antiquarian mind, ignorant of the nature of Catholic devotion, might easily mix the two sequences into historical order, and possibly misunderstand the Assumption (obviously, as Mary reappears two images on at the Ascension, it is out of order). I wonder what they thought it was?  A couple of other things about the east window that you shouldn't miss. Firstly, everywhere you look there are tiny baskets - Mortlock calls them 'frails', and tells us that they were simple rush baskets used by workmen to carry tools. Also, though not in such profusion, there are bodices. These symbols are repeated elsewhere in the church in stone on tombs, and as such must be symbols of the Harling family.  Another symbol is high up on the north side, a red squirrel. Curiously, this also appears in the painting A Lady with a Squirrel and a Starling by Hans Holbein, now thought to be a portrait of Anne Lovell - the squirrel is a symbol of the Lovell family, who took over the local manor here from the Harlings in the 16th century, and the starling represents Ea- well, you guess.  In July 2006, Chris Harrison and I came across  some more glass from East Harling  in the Norfolk County Archaeologist Service archive at Gressenhall. It was probably removed from the church for safety in 1939, and then not replaced, possibly ending up at the museum of church art in Norwich at St Peter Hungate, disappearing into storage when that closed in 1993. It depicts a Bishop and Christ seated in Majesty, and the lozenges in between carry the telltale frails and bodices familiar from other glass within the church.  Within the screen is a large chapel, containing two major tombs. One is in alabaster, an early 17th century memorial to Sir Thomas and Lady Alice Lovell (remember the squirrel?) who died in 1604. The piece is good - too good, its 1950s restoration gives it a Festival of Britain air. Their symbols lie at their feet - his a magnificent peacock, hers a gruesome Saracen scalp held aloft.  The other appears to be a composite. It lies to the east, and the two effigies are clearly not from this tomb; they simply don't fit. They are supposed to be Robert Harling, died Paris in 1435, and his wife Dame Joan. Neither are buried here - she is at Rushford near Thetford, he is in some corner of a foreign field that is forever French schoolchildren on picnics excitedly tugging old thighbones from the soil - but in any case it is the trimmings of the tomb rather than the effigies that are most of interest, including a pelican in her piety and one that is almost a lily crucifix.  On the north side of the chancel is a fine tomb with brass inlays - the brasses now gone. Not as magnificent as either of the two previously mentioned, it is actually the most significant, as this is where you'll find Anne Harling, wife of the serial rebuilders of this church. Look out for those flails again.  What more? 17th century Lovells (remember the squirrel) have in-yer-face memorials either side of the sanctuary - that to the north curiously with no inscription. There are hatchments, remains of a wallpainting that are too indistinct to interpret (but may be seven works of mercy), a good set of royal arms, medieval heads, curious 19th century bench ends of a lion and a wild man, heraldic misericords, a Dec font - well, come and see for yourself. You know you want to."

It was one of the many sights recommended to us by my old mate Wurz and his wonderful Partner in Crime Katia.  Having never seen in the flesh (so to speak) massive Soviet Sculptures and having a slight obsession with World Wars 1 and 2, it didn't fail to disappoint. Hidden away in Treptower Park, we got lost looking for it and by the time we found it we were the wrong side of the massive wrought iron railings that surronded it and had to walk round the perimeter until we found the entrance. Cath's feet were killing her as she had worn the wrong trainers and I was desperate for the loo but find it we did.

St Peter and St Paul, East Harling, Norfolk  With its aisles, clerestory, porch and chancel, St Peter and St Paul is a textbook example of its century, although there are a number of curiosities that add even more interest. The vestry on the north side of the chancel, for example, which was once a shrine chapel, retains its image niche on its eastern face. And there are more image niches, these with elaborate foliage pedestals, in the buttresses of the tower; everything is topped off by a lead and timber fleche which was apparently the model for the one at St Peter Mancroft in Norwich, a church which has several features in common with this one.  The tower is a delight, the buttressing and pinnacles exactly in proportion to make it appear to rise like a fairy castle from the ground. The south porch, by contrast, is, despite its flushwork, rather austere, a result of its rebuilding early in the 19th century before the ecclesiological movement took hold. All in all, this is as good as 15th century rebuilding gets, the money coming thanks to Anne Harling having no less than three husbands who all wanted to spend as little time in purgatory as possible.  You step down into a wide space which, on a dull day, can be rather gloomy. Although inevitably heavily restored by the Victorians, St Peter and St Paul does not have that depressingly anonymous urban feel you so often find in churches of this size. This is partly because the beautiful parclose screen in the south aisle partitions off so much space, creating a sense of rooms within rooms, altering the way your eyes are inevitably drawn to the east. The rood screen must have been vast here; its dado survives at the west end, a deeply traceried affair with its features presented in carving rather than painting.  When the rood screen was in its proper place, to move from the nave into the chancel must have been like stepping from darkness into light. This is because of the feature that makes East Harling famous, the vast east window with its 15th century glass. After St Peter Mancroft it is the best collection in Norfolk. Unusually, the provenance of the glass is fairly well-documented: we can be fairly certain that it came from this church originally. Still present after the Reformation, it was removed by the Harling family to the Hall in the early 17th century. They may have been Laudians wanting to preserve it from the intentions of the puritans, or merely thought it would look nice in their dining hall; whatever, we know that shortly before Francis Blomefield visited here in the 1730s it was returned to the church and set in its present configuration.  In 1939, when war threatened, it was removed again, being reset just before Cautley visited in the early 1950s. There are parts of at least three sequences here, two of which were almost certainly in the east window originally, and one which almost certainly wasn't.  Essentially, the window contains two rosary sequences; the Joyful Mysteries of the Blessed Virgin, which include the Annunciation, the Nativity and the Assumption, and the Sorrowful Mysteries of the Blessed Virgin, which include the Crucifixion and the Deposition. However, this is open to interpretation, as we shall see. There is also the figure of St Mary Magdalene, which may once have been associated with a nave altar, and would have been located in a window there.  The five lights contain four rows of panels, making twenty altogether.  Top row: I. Annunciation: Mary at her prayer desk. Gabriel, crowned and haloed, with a sceptre of lilies, kneels in supplication. II. Visitation: Elizabeth, hooded to show her age, places her hand on Mary's pregnant belly. III. Nativity: Two midwives look on. The infant in the manger is rayed; a horned cow gazes in awe. IV. Adoration of the Shepherds: One holds a lamb, one plays pipes. A third appears to offer a fleece. V. Adoration of the Magi: Two of the wise men gauge each others' reactions as the third offers his gift.  Second row: VI: collection of fragments. VII: Presentation in the Temple: Joseph carries the doves, Mary offers the child to Simeon. Anna is not shown. VIII: The Finding in the Temple: Head covered, Mary bursts in among the men to find her son teaching. IX: The Wedding at Canaa: Christ, seated at the top table, blesses a chicken and a ham. Mary directs the servant. X: collection of fragments.  Third row: XI: Mary of Magdala: Mary holds her long hair ready to anoint Christ's feet. Probably not from this window originally. XII: The Betrayal at Gethsemane: Judas kisses Christ; Peter cuts off the ear of the high priest's servant. XIII: Crucifixion: Mary swoons in John's arms. XIV: Deposition from the cross: The pieta. Tears spring from Mary's eyes. XV: Assumption of the Blessed Virgin: Mary is assumed bodily into heaven.  Bottom row: XVI: Donor: Probably Robert Wingfield, second husband of Anne Harling. XVII: Resurrection: Christ steps fully clothed from the tomb. Unusually, the soldiers are awake. XVIII: Ascension of Christ: Mary, surrounded by disciples, watches as her son ascends to heaven. XIX: Descent of the Holy Spirit: Mary, surrounded by disciples, receives the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. XX: Donor: Probably William Chamberlain, first husband of Anne Harling.  Nowadays, we tend to think of the rosary as consisting of three sequences of five mysteries each, but in the late middle ages things were much more flexible, and rosary sequences often consisted of seven mysteries. The Glorious Mysteries sequence, of which the Assumption is now a part, is a later development, and the two adorations shown here are subsumed into a single mystery. There are a couple of images here that don't quite fit; the Wedding at Canaa is obviously a Marian text, and yet is not traditionally a rosary subject. Similarly the Betrayal, the only one of the images not to feature Mary. I wonder if what we have here are parts of two separate sequences, a Marian sequence of mysteries (I-V, VII-IX, XV), and a Passion sequence (XII-XIV, XVII-XIX). They are both clearly the work of the same workshop, and Mary is always shown with the same face and dress, but this would not preclude them from being two sequences.  Why were they here at all? We need to get away from thinking of such things as a 'poor man's bible', the need for which was superseded at the Reformation. These were devotional objects, designed to be used as meditations while praying and saying the rosary. They were created in the 15th century, a time when the mind of the Church was fiercely concentrated on asserting orthodox Catholic doctrine in the face of local superstitions and abuses. As such, they were anathema to the reformers, and were later elsewhere destroyed for being superstitious, not for being superfluous. An 18th century antiquarian mind, ignorant of the nature of Catholic devotion, might easily mix the two sequences into historical order, and possibly misunderstand the Assumption (obviously, as Mary reappears two images on at the Ascension, it is out of order). I wonder what they thought it was?  A couple of other things about the east window that you shouldn't miss. Firstly, everywhere you look there are tiny baskets - Mortlock calls them 'frails', and tells us that they were simple rush baskets used by workmen to carry tools. Also, though not in such profusion, there are bodices. These symbols are repeated elsewhere in the church in stone on tombs, and as such must be symbols of the Harling family.  Another symbol is high up on the north side, a red squirrel. Curiously, this also appears in the painting A Lady with a Squirrel and a Starling by Hans Holbein, now thought to be a portrait of Anne Lovell - the squirrel is a symbol of the Lovell family, who took over the local manor here from the Harlings in the 16th century, and the starling represents Ea- well, you guess.  In July 2006, Chris Harrison and I came across  some more glass from East Harling  in the Norfolk County Archaeologist Service archive at Gressenhall. It was probably removed from the church for safety in 1939, and then not replaced, possibly ending up at the museum of church art in Norwich at St Peter Hungate, disappearing into storage when that closed in 1993. It depicts a Bishop and Christ seated in Majesty, and the lozenges in between carry the telltale frails and bodices familiar from other glass within the church.  Within the screen is a large chapel, containing two major tombs. One is in alabaster, an early 17th century memorial to Sir Thomas and Lady Alice Lovell (remember the squirrel?) who died in 1604. The piece is good - too good, its 1950s restoration gives it a Festival of Britain air. Their symbols lie at their feet - his a magnificent peacock, hers a gruesome Saracen scalp held aloft.  The other appears to be a composite. It lies to the east, and the two effigies are clearly not from this tomb; they simply don't fit. They are supposed to be Robert Harling, died Paris in 1435, and his wife Dame Joan. Neither are buried here - she is at Rushford near Thetford, he is in some corner of a foreign field that is forever French schoolchildren on picnics excitedly tugging old thighbones from the soil - but in any case it is the trimmings of the tomb rather than the effigies that are most of interest, including a pelican in her piety and one that is almost a lily crucifix.  On the north side of the chancel is a fine tomb with brass inlays - the brasses now gone. Not as magnificent as either of the two previously mentioned, it is actually the most significant, as this is where you'll find Anne Harling, wife of the serial rebuilders of this church. Look out for those flails again.  What more? 17th century Lovells (remember the squirrel) have in-yer-face memorials either side of the sanctuary - that to the north curiously with no inscription. There are hatchments, remains of a wallpainting that are too indistinct to interpret (but may be seven works of mercy), a good set of royal arms, medieval heads, curious 19th century bench ends of a lion and a wild man, heraldic misericords, a Dec font - well, come and see for yourself. You know you want to."

The mood of the valley in full fall colors frosted over by the foggy mist that clung to the river and flowed even more gently over the surface moving in and out of the trees and across the reflections.  I was calmly aware of every breath of cold air and it was invigorating.

Originally based in mainland China, the Republic of China now governs the island of Taiwan (formerly known as Formosa), which makes up over 99% of its territory,[f] as well as Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu, and other minor islands.   Shifen waterfall (traditional Chinese:) is a scenic waterfall perching between Dahua and Shifen Stations on the Pingxi Line and located in the Shifen Scenic Area in Pingxi District, New Taipei City. Shifen Waterfall is a block waterfall that is 15 to 20 meters high and 40 meters wide. As a cascade waterfall similar to Niagara Falls, where the bedrock slopes in the opposite direction of the water flow, Shifen Waterfall is known as Taiwans Niagara Falls and is the largest waterfall along the Pingxi Line. Torrents of water tumble down thunderously from the precipice into the deep pool beneath, creating a breathtaking and mesmerizing sight. Because the Shifen Waterfall is shrouded in mist for the majority of the year, iridescent rainbows often appear against a clear sky when the sun shines on the droplets of the waterfall. For this reason, Shifen Waterfall is also called the Rainbow Pond. More often than not, visitors to Shifen Waterfall cannot help feeling great awe for this spectacular natural phenomenon.  This waterfall falls on residential ground  currently and the owner of this land collect entry fee from visitors , making substantial amount of money. Accordingly to my tour guide , there is plan by the government to collect back this piece of land and the entry will be free therefore. ....  you can visit my website at www.on9cloud.com .

At the foot of the fortified rocks 609.6 meters above the sea level stands the town of Bhongir, it has a unique egg-shaped construction with two entry points protected by huge rocks, so the fort was considered practically impregnable by invading armies. The splendid historical fort with the awe-inspiring rock and the aesthetically fortified courts which have stood the ravages of time stir the imagination of tourists. A moat that encircles the fort, a vast underground chamber, trap doors, an armoury, stables, ponds, wells etc., make for fascinating viewing. The view from the top of the surrounding countryside is simply breathtaking. The Bala Hisar or citadel on the top of the hill gives a bird's eye view of the neighbouring area. The fort is associated with the rule of the heroic queen Rudramadevi and her grandson Prataparudra. "

Now the home belongs to my cousin and her husband and I'm still in awe of just how low the big jets fly over this neighborhood even to this day.   Before I shot this, two other jets followed this same flight path. Hearing the sound of the turbine engines getting closer and closer was all I needed to prep for this shot.  I wanted to stay for a 747 takeoff, but it was the wrong time of day.    on a side note, there is a story of a 747 taking off from SFO.  Immediately after they took to the air and started getting set, the pilot turned on the auto pilot (as was the habit then) and turned around to talk and do some other things (which wasn't unusual). Well, what he didn't know was that the auto pilot didn't engage, or it disengaged and they were headed straight for this very hillside... suddenly the alarms were going off, alerting the crew that they were in a big heap of trouble.  Both the pilot and the co-pilot had to pull back on the controls together with all their might, in an effort to pull the giant aircraft up from it's hillside trajectory and as luck would have it they missed the houses on this hill by a mere 200 feet.  The sound the people heard in these houses must have been incredible."

May 23 - 9 June 2014   One of the most popular Vivid Sydney installations is back, offering everyone another chance to design their own light show on this iconic piece of Australian architecture.  From an interactive touchscreen located on the boardwalk near Luna Park, choose your own colours and sequences, and watch in awe as your illuminated creation brings life to the beautiful grey arches.  Stacked with over 100,000 energy efficient LED lights, Light the Bridge  has been designed especially for Vivid Sydney by those luminaries of illumination, Iain Reed and 32 Hundred Lighting, and has 4th Generation Intel Core Processors at its heart.   www.vividsydney.com/events/light-the-bridge   www.vividsydney.com/?gclid=CjkKEQjw75CcBRCz2LiEs5OPsZoBEi...

This is one of the many lakes on the trail through Plitvice Lakes National Park in Croatia.  I wrote in detail about the science of Plitvice Lakes in part 4 of my blog  Seeking Science along the Adriatic Coast .   When I'm not in awe of these lakes, you can find me on Twitter "

Peru Located about three hours south of Lima there are some Ballestas Islands, which constitute one of the most popular tourist destinations in Peru for lovers of marine wildlife, amazing birds, and beautiful scenery. Sometimes called the ""Poor Man's Galapagos"" because of the cheap price to visit them, las Islas Ballestas are full of wild animals such as sea lions, starfish, fur seals, terns, zarcillos, and endangered Humboldt penguins.  Impressive is not just the wide range of animals, but the awe-inspiring quantity of birds: some islands have colonies of up to 600,000 birds flying in an and out an any time. Depending on the season, lucky visitors may also see acquatic mammals such as whales and dolphins.  For many years, the Ballestas Islands were a major money-making enterprise for the Peruvian people. This is because bird poop, known more formally as guano, is one of the most potent and popular forms of fertilizer in the world.   The millions of marine birds on the islands produce a fair amount of the stuff every year - in the hundreds of tons - and enterprising people used to collect the guano and sell it."

Waited for hours for sunset but didn't get as great of light as i had hoped (and a little too windy) but it was an amazing experience nonetheless.  Ran into a couple of of fellow flickr members too so enjoyed the conversation as we were seiged upon by mosquitos! This is a blend of two long exposures using a 10-stop ND along with the usual tweaks here and there. Cheers!

Designated a World Heritage Site in 1984, Yosemite is internationally recognized for its spectacular granite cliffs, waterfalls, clear streams, Giant Sequoia groves, and biological diversity.  From the waterfall-striped granite walls buttressing emerald-green Yosemite Valley to the skyscraping giant sequoias catapulting into the air at Mariposa Grove, the place inspires a sense of awe and reverence. But lift your eyes above the crowds and youll feel your heart instantly moved by unrivalled splendors: the haughty profile of Half Dome, the hulking presence of El Capitan, the drenching mists of Yosemite Falls, the gemstone lakes of the high countrys subalpine wilderness and Hetch Hetchys pristine pathways."

Access to the Castle is sometimes restricted by higher-than-usual levels of water in the Loch, at which times the site effectively becomes a temporary island.  It was the ancestral home of the Campbells of Glen Orchy, who later became the Earls of Breadalbane also known as the Breadalbane family branch, of the Clan Campbell. The earliest construction on the castle was the towerhouse and Laich Hall (looks onto Loch Awe). Today, its picturesque setting and romantic state of decay make it one of the most photographed structures in Scotland."

This vista is on the plateau overlooking Merlin's Cave.  It is a wonderful coastalinlet. Birds soar below and you can hear the thunderous surf  crashing against the cliff walls...and always the rugged moor in the distance, a moor inhabited at times by Phoenician traders, Romans, and then small groups of medieval nomads.   Awed by the beauty, I am nonetheless reminded of that wonderful hymn verse ""A thousand ages in thy sight are like an evening gone...""    Perspective changes. I am also very much reminded of some of the beauty in our own country...along the Maine shore, or the Pacific coastline in Northern California....  Ponder AND enjoy!    Laura "

I'm in total awe whenever I get outside the city and see all the starts in the sky. My goal this past summer was to get more into night sky photography, but family circumstances made it difficult.  In any case, last Friday evening the skies were clear and the moon set to rise about 1AM, so I headed outside the city and found my favourite old combine.   I like the shot, but I think I gained more from it as a learning experience such as:  1. It's harder than I thought to compose a shot through the viewfinder in darkness even with a flashlight hitting the subject. Next time I'll try Live View.  2. This time of year it gets really cold fast on the open prairies even with just a light wind. I wasn't as patient to get things setup or make adjustments.  3. The backroads change a lot when it's dark. I thought I knew the way to this old combine pretty well, but doubted myself a lot as I was driving towards it. Nothing looked familiar in the dark.  4. I was surprised how many lights were visible in the scene I was trying to capture, but that is impossible to know in the day time when scouting.  In any case, I'll try again and see if I can learn from this one.  Thanks for looking."

Nonetheless, the hike in new territory seeing and being in a new space is always good for the mind. After my journey to Monteverde, I went to the small town of La Fortuna. On my departing journey from Monteverde, there had to be at least 15 rainbows or ""arcoiris"" ...incredible. The locals there find it comical when others marvel at the rainbows...its a common occurrence in Monteverde...with clear skies and rainbows galore...it set the pace for my descending trip from the cloud forest. La Fortuna's landscape is dominated by Volcn Arenal. I was told 80% of people who visit La Fortuna actually get to see the full view of the volcano as there are too many clouds. I was fotunate to be able to see the whole thing and wow what a sight. If you havent seen a volcano as I hadn't, it is awe inspiring, such a massive feature in the landscape. After sleeping a night, the next day I hiked around the Volcano and got to see a nice view of the valley and Lake. Afterwards in the evening, I went to a natural hotspring river where the water was a pleasantly hot temperature and relaxed."

This was the greatest Phoenician city at the time of the greatest Phoenician achievements, an impregnable island fortress widely considered unconquerable.  It was also such an important outpost of the Persian empire in 332 BC, that Alexander the Great knew he had to conquer it (or the local fleet would have attacked Greece once Alexander's forces had marched further east), and so it was here that his engineers invented and first used the torsion catapult and built a 1/2 km. long causeway for use in one of the most amazing sieges in history.  www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1GIHgUgLZI   - King Hiram had an offshore fortress built on the island, and It was from here that he ruled a maritime empire in the 900s BC that produced the best sailors the world had yet seen to explore further than anyone would until the Vikings went on tour 1700 years later, passing the 'pillars of Hercules' at Gibraltar, rounding the Cape of Good Hope (according to Herodotus), and sailing north to Wales to trade for tin.  Their journeys, which could be the greatest in ancient history, began here.  They might have been inspired by Hiram, their 'sea king', whose throne ""sat before large windows opening upon the sea and crashing waves"" and by the central importance of the worship of gods of the sea in Phoenician religion (Melkart, a principle Phoenician deity, was god of the sea and storms, and Baal was a son of the fish god Dagon and a patron deity of mariners.)   - There's evidence that Sidon and Byblos paid tribute to Tyre as it grew in a period of Egyptian decline and a lull in the procession of aggressive Mesopotamian empires.  (Babylon was in eclipse and Assyria was at rest.  The 900s BC would be remembered as a golden age until 911 and the return of Assyrian aggression and dominance, which would last until 612 and the destruction of Nineveh).   It was from Tyre that the Phoenicians colonized much of the Mediterranean, establishing Cyrene and Sabratha (in Libya), and colonies at Cyprus, Rhodes, Crete, Malta, Sicily, Sardinia, Marseilles, Cadiz, and, of course, Carthage, which became the greatest rival and threat that Rome would face before the appearance of the Huns.  Tyre's early history was so widely admired and romanticized that when the Judaean authors of the Old testament were glorifying David and Solomon in the early to mid 1st mill. BC, they made a point to portray them as the BFFs of Hiram, who supplied Solomon with plenty of cedar for the First temple in Jerusalem which he paid for generously with ""20,000 cors of wheat...and 20,000 cors of beaten oil"" to be paid every year (1 Kings 5:1-12), and Solomon later gave Hiram a gift of 20 cities in the land of Galilee.  ""Hiram's servants, 'shipmen that had knowledge of the sea,' taught the sailors of Solomon the route from Ezion-geber and Eloth to Ophir, whence large stores of gold were brought to King Solomon (1 Ki 9:26; 2 Ch 8:17 f)"".  www.bible-history.com/isbe/H/HIRAM/  No physical evidence has  been found of the glorious early 1st mill. kingdom of the briefly united lands of Israel and Judah under David, Solomon, and Rehoboam described in the Bible.  There is evidence however that David existed and founded a dynasty; the Tell Dan stele refers to a king of the 'House of David'  (I had the chance to see the stele when it was brought to Montreal in '03. pacmusee.qc.ca/en/exhibitions/detail/archaeology-and-the-... ).   Many modern historians now believe that after Israel had been devastated by the Assyrians in the 720s BC, when Sargon II carried 27,000 Israelites away into captivity, the southern Judaeans came to rule over the land of Israel (in a fashion;  Israel became a client state of the Assyrians), and to validate their rule they expanded on their early history (something to be expected in any record of a history of early rulers that was first passed down through oral tradition over centuries, or even decades), presenting David and Solomon, Judaean kings, or chieftains, based in Jerusalem, then a city on the summit and slope of a hill, as rulers of a great empire of vast wealth, romancing Sabaean queens and hanging with Hiram, the Phoenician king of Tyre, a city which truly was a big, awe-inspiring deal at that time.  In the Book of Ezekiel (28: 1-4), Yahweh conveys a warning to Hiram not to let success go to his head and claim that he is a god, ""in the seat of gods, in the midst of the sea"".  To give (much) credit to Hiram, he continues: ""Behold, you are wiser than Daniel! .. By your great wisdom in trade you have increased your riches...""  (28:12-13)  You were ""the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. ... .""  But wealth leads to pride, and the proud are doomed (28: 6-9):  ""I will bring ... the most terrible of the nations; and they shall ... defile your splendor.  They shall throw you down into the pit ... (etc.).""        (If it was believed in the 500s BC when the Book of Ezekiel was written that Hiram had helped in the construction of the 1st temple over 300 years earlier, that could be sufficient basis for the amount of attention paid to him by Ezekiel and biblical authors.  Any Lebanese cedar used would have been purchased in Tyre, the southernmost Phoenician city-state, so there could have been a connection between Jerusalem and Tyre if not with Hiram directly).  It's ironic if Hiram is best known today for what the Old testament authors wrote about him to give heft to David and Solomon in the early-to-mid-1st-millenium BC.  David and Solomon have long since returned the favour.        - Update Nov. 2017:   These past 2 weeks I've been reading some in vol. II of Amlie Kuhrt's encyclopedic 'The Ancient Near East,' from '95, which predates the article that was a basis for much of what I'd written above re the aggrandizement of David and Solomon.  She confirms (although, again, 22 years back) that there's nothing in the archaeological record which supports the accounts in the books of Kings and Samuel of the brief but glorious 10th century united kingdom of Israel and Judah, although the Tel Dan stele confirms the existence of a dynasty or 'house' in the late 800s sired by David.  But she notes that this shouldn't be surprising as so little in the way of written evidence of anything from that period has been found in the region, and as Jerusalem itself had been built over and rebuilt over as much as it has in the millenia since then.  And so absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence. (""It must be stressed that it is above all due to the accounts in the Old Testament that a reconstruction of the history of Israel and Judah is possible - if we did not have it, Israel and Judah would be little more than names in the Assyrian annals, and Hamath, Sam'al, Bit Agusi, even Moab would be much better known.  The reason is that no lengthy monumental inscriptions have been recovered from either Israel or Judah  for this period...  Apart from reference to Israel in an inscription from Moab, and the possible mention of Judah in a stele fragment from Tel Dan, the only certain extra-biblical references to Israel and Judah occur in the Assyrian records."")   But then Prof. V.J. Stenger had this to say in 2007:  ""Some have argued that the remains of Solomon's temple and other signs of a [10th cent. BC] golden age in Jerusalem have been wiped out by later building projects.  However, the extensive excavations carried on in Jerusalem in modern times have yielded impressive finds from much earlier periods such as the Middle Bronze Age and Iron Age."" www.humanreligions.info/did_king_solomon_exist.html   Then again, ""excavations directed by the late Prof. Y. Shiloh, uncovered a monumental 20 m. stepped structure, and dated it to the 12th-10th cent. BC,."" and which some claim to be a basis of the Jebusite town that David conquered.  And there are details in the books of Samuel (considered to contain the earliest records in the Old Testament) re David's conquest of Jerusalem which are consistent with features in the 'city of David', the oldest part of town.  www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/myth-and-reality-of-king-dav...  And more in that vein.  www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/palace-king-david.html  The truth is out there.    - Tyre was the original home of queen Jezebel, wife of the Israelite king Ahab (condemned by Elijah to be eaten by dogs for her worship of Phoenician gods), and of Europa, a princess abducted by Zeus in the form of a white bull and taken to Crete where she gave birth to Minos, who became king of the Minoan civilization, the first in Europe (which may be why Europe was named after her).  It was also ruled by king Pygmalion, whose legendary sister Dido fled from her home here to Berber territory in North Africa where she founded Carthage.   - The island withstood sieges by the Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar and co., and by the Achaemenid Persians (Phoenician sailing prowess was instrumental to the Persian conquest of Egypt earlier in the history of the Persian empire), until the incredible 7 month siege by Alexander the Great, who built a 1/2 km.-long causeway to the island under cover of his innovative new catapults, laid waste to Tyre, crucified 2,000 locals on the shore, and sold 30,000 into slavery.  But as you can see here, although Tyre's most glorious period ended with Hellenism, Tyre continued as a great centre.  The Roman ruins are impressive, and the Hippodrome here was the largest in the ancient world (in area, but not in seating.)  Tyre continued to be a wealthy, influential place throughout the Byzantine period.  In the period of the crusades, it took several sieges before the city was taken by Christian forces.  It was the only city to hold out against Baldwin I of Jerusalem, and it held out against Saladin as well.

It represents the third stage in that king's elaborate building plans at Luxor Temple, and though it chronologically precedes the Great Court, it follows that element geographically. Indeed, this one hundred meter long colonnade is a part of the oldest segment of this temple.  These fourteen great columns in two rows erected during Amenhotep III's reign, though only completed after his death, may have originally been intended as the main axis of what was to become a great hypostyle hall, similar to the one at Karnak. However, if that is true, it was never finished. The colonnade was finished during the reign of Tutankhamun, Ay and Horemheb.  The axis of this colonnade, as well as the chambers south of it, is clearly different than the later Ramesside additions that precede it in the temple. We believe that the change was made after Ramesses II decided to physically connect Luxor Temple by a causeway with the Temple of Khonsu at Karnak, which had a different axial alignment.  The columns, which stand 19 meters high, have open papyrus capitals that support a roof 21 meters above the ground. They are surmounted by abacus, which in turn support architrave blocks. The space is narrow, being only ten meters wide. Originally, it had walls that rose to the full height of the roof, with only small clerestory windows cut at the ceiling level to allow in sunlight. However, it is difficult today to appreciate just how impressive this chamber must have been, because the walls now only rise some a few meters high. Yet, to have walked into this dark and forbidding colonnade during ancient times, passing from the open, brightly lit courtyard must have been awe inspiring [touregypt.net]"

The vista includes the La Sal mountain from a distance, the rugged Colorado plateau and vertical rock spires. After setting up and waiting in the dark, the magic starts as the sun begins to rise.

These are from Return trip telling all of quite the adventure we had with 3.5 hr detour/ wrong turn, 2 tire blowouts & now need for new bumper. In photojournalistic style I have uploaded (22) new photos. I am uploading them in order of what I think are the best as the latest (or at least some of my favourites) BUT I will ALSO label them with numbers so that you can track the journey the way in which it unfolded it if you have interest :D So, it all began when we looked at a free map in the middle of one of those free magazine we picked up; to our delight we saw a short cut to the freeway which we were sure our 4x4 could handle and we were up for the Adventure! Lol. These first 2 shots are right where we got mesmerized by those clouds that were rolling down the mountain majestically (sadly, my photography could not capture the true beauty) In awe of the clouds, at the fork in the road- we headed right towards the mountains- instead of left 13 miles to the highway!!! Ikes!!!! We embarked on what resulted in a journey up and around/ across a mountain range, experiencing extreme differences from Desert temperatures and scenery to a beautiful icy/snowy Winterscape and back down to ALMOST the exact same spot we were at 3.5 hours prior. We kept going up the mountain despite the private property and keep out signs because we thought we were on public road and the highway was going to be just over the other side of the hill. Eh hem, well on the way back down we hit some pretty crazy dirt roads which compromised our already old spare tire and right as we got on the highway. Blowout!!!.... anyways we were grateful for the journey, the amazing scenes we saw, for experiencing the extreme weather/ temperature differences of California with a few thousand feet elevation within an hour, not breaking down up in the cold mountains and the Adventure. We werent so grateful for the towing bill in the Desert, the extra hotel nights stay when we broke down due to no spare tire anymore and no where open on a Sunday night to purchase them in the Desert, and the upsell to 4 NEW tires that we bigger than our last because that was all they had in stock ;-) Fun times and thanks to photography, we can remember more to tell the tale!! Happy week everyone and thanks for visiting, comments and reading my post!!!   "

Previously, I used a large-format view-camera and Velvia film, and made an 8-second exposure in the ""blue hour"" after the sun had set.   On this occasion, I used a Lumix GH2 mid-afternoon: with enough filtration, several long exposures blended together to give much the same effect.

This is my take on Culver Hole on the eastern side of the bay at Overton Mere, just across the headland from Port Eynon.  We chose to go this weekend as low tide coincided with approximately the middle of the day which meant it was nice and easy to get there at the right time without having to forego a weekend lie-in!   Vikki being a little unsteady on her feet over really rough going, chose not to attempt to get down to the lower level here as I did, but will no doubt upset me by providing a higher level view that blows this one away. But I have to say that I am really pleased to have finally got here and seen this in all its glory as it is far more awe-inspiring in real life than I can manage to make it look in a picture!  And before anyone asks, no I didn't attempt to climb the rope into the lower levels and get inside, as it was a thin rope and I am too unfit (and fat!)  for that sort of nonsense at the moment...maybe another time."

Gaze in wonder at the white flowstones and in awe at the beauty of the speleothems which adorn the cave.  Harrisons Cave is named for Thomas Harrison, who owned much of the land in the area in the early 1700s. In 1733, Harrison established a school that is todays Harrison College. Its not clear whether Mr. Harrison ever entered the cave that bears his name  but others certainly did.  During the 18th and 19th centuries, several expeditions ventured into Harrisons Cave, none of which got very far. Because the natural entrances to Harrisons Cave were hard to get to, and the caves inside passages presented many challenges, the cave remained an unexplored mystery until 1970.

Not great but ok.   Buffalo was once a national center of heavy industry. It still has one of the nation's most versatile and dense rail hubs. Until the 1980s the shores of the river were lined edge to edge with heavy industry. Steel, Iron, chemicals, grain, cement, petroleum and many smaller industries once hummed 24/7. Now the shores are largely abandoned, although once can still see the sea walls, pilings and remnants of docks where the massive lake freighters navigated up through the Buffalo River's sinuous channels to park...often 5 end to end and 3 deep. UNlike the massive silos down the river, nearer to Lake Erie, these industries were torn down, the buildings razed and the machinery sold for scrap. It's amazing how little remains of the some of the world's most powerful industrial centers....Only the docks and sheet pilings show where freighters docked and unloaded piles of ore, limestone and coal that reached several stories tall. They are eerie, weedy overgrown fields. The railroad bridges also still remain and are still part of one of the nation's important rail hubs connecting Lake Erie to the interior of the US.  The legacy of Buffalo's industry can be seen in the incredibly ornate buildings and rich history. HOwever another legacy of these industries is some extreme pollution. In the 1980s when the last of the heavy industry closed the land around this river was so badly contaminated as to be uninhabitable. The river itself was essentially dead. It had a permanent rainbow hue and smelled like petroleum. The mud is contaminated with almost every chemical and metal one can think of and almost no life could survive...except for noxious invasive weeds and species. In 1968 the river caught fire as a welder's spark ignited thick, goopy mats of crude oil. Sewage poured in and at times the industries drew so much water for cooling that the river flowed in reverse and the temperature changed. As mentioned above ships once choked the harbor, necessitating creation of mazes of canals, intensive dredging, hardening of shorelines all which changed the flow and ecology of the river forever.   The river is slowly recovering due to EPA regulations and loss of industry. While they were awe inspiring and spawned great wealth and innovation for about 70 years their legacy is mixed. Perhaps if they were still employing tens of thousands workers and building the local economy one could possibly forgive their uninformed and sloppy environmental past, and feel more sympathy for their plight in the modern world. When they locked the gates for the last time they went away...no longer a legal person anymore....and consciously, legally, and deliberately, left their leaking tanks and pipes and transformers, and ponds of chemicals, piles of slag, radioactivity, mounds of asbestos, soot and coke waste, etc... Thus rebuilding the river and protecting it is now more important because the benefits of business are just too fleeting to be justified. This night trip reminds me that the river is for people and should not be allowed to degrade so badly again.  A wonderful night, warm with a pleasant breeze, pleasent company and a huge full moon to light the way. What more could one ask for?   "

They have several different morphologies that represent several different cnidarian classes including the Scyphozoa (over 200 species), Staurozoa (about 50 species), Cubozoa (about 20 species), and Hydrozoa (about 1000-1500 species that make jellyfish and many more that do not).  The jellyfish in these groups are also called, respectively, scyphomedusae, stauromedusae, cubomedusae, and hydromedusae; medusa is another word for jellyfish. (Medusa is also the word for jellyfish in Modern Greek, Finnish, Portuguese, Romanian, Hebrew, Serbian, Croatian, Spanish, Italian, Hungarian, Polish, Lithuanian, Czech, Slovak, Russian, Bulgarian and Catalan).[citation needed]Jellyfish are found in every ocean, from the surface to the deep sea.[citation needed] Some hydrozoan jellyfish, or hydromedusae, are also found in fresh water and are less than half an inch in size. They are partially white and clear and do not sting. This article focuses on scyphomedusae. These are the large, often colorful, jellyfish that are common in coastal zones worldwide.In its broadest sense, the term jellyfish also generally refers to members of the phylum Ctenophora. Although not closely related to cnidarian jellyfish, ctenophores are also free-swimming planktonic carnivores, are generally transparent or translucent, and exist in shallow to deep portions of all the world's oceans. Jellyfish are probably some of the most unusual and mysterious creatures that you'll ever encounter. They have drifted along on ocean currents for millions of years, even before dinosaurs lived on the Earth  Photo taken at  the Monterey Bay Aquarium In Monterey, California.

They were discovered in 1961 by James Kieghlev, while performing an aerial survey of the region,  Some of the geoglyphs are as large as 300 ft/100 meters.  A later survey by geologist Robert Hamilton and engineer Emil de Bruyne resulted in the realization that the region was, at one point, populated by large agriculturally based culture with large settlements and ceremonial centers.  The largest of the geoglyphs is ""EL GIGANTE"" (the ""Giant""), which is almost 400 ft long (120 meters).   To date, on the hill-sides of Atacama, have been found representations of: humans, animals, and geometric designs.  The appears to use similar techniques to those found on the Nazca Plateau of Peru.  Unfortunately, access to these geoglyphs is restricted by lack of roads, making a walking trek necessary to view them. There are over 5,000 prehistoric geoglyphs in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile, and like the Nazca lines of Peru, they are mysterious, beautiful and awe-inspiring.  Although we can't know the entire reason they were built, researcher Luis Briones believes they are part sign post and part story-telling along a transportation network connecting the South American civilizations in combined commercial and religious travel led by caravans of llamas.     www.nazcamystery.com/atacama.htm"
