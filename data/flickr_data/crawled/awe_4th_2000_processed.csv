During the late 1600 s the Campbells started to turn it into a stronghold taking 10 years to complete. Little was made of the stronghold other than as an outpost for government troops during the Jacobite Rebellions of 1715 and 1745. The castle's dramatic situation at the head of Loch Awe, with the peak of Ben Cruachan visible make it one of the most photographed castles in Scotland"

May 23 - 9 June 2014   From Tinker Bell to Titania, fairies  have long inhabited our folklore, our literature and most of all the realms of our childhood imaginations. Perhaps when you were very young, the reflected light of a mirror became a mischievous elf; maybe the sound of a triangle being struck or the breeze in the trees inspired you to hope you might just encounter these delicate, magical beings.  Vivid Sydney lures these dwellers of fantastical dimensions to our harbourside, with When the fairies come out to play.   The artwork comprises 200 illuminated, kinetic ornaments which flit and flutter playfully, shimmering in the dark and allowing themselves to be seen by the mere mortals who wander through the park. These tiny sprites recreate the sense of awe you once felt when you believed in the possibility of enchanted forests, bewitched flowers and spirits that lived at the bottom of your garden.  The fairies are brought to life by energy-efficient, pre-programmed LED chips, which continuously twinkle through the colour spectrum.

She was born in a tiny little village by the mountains named Only. It was a peculiar place because every person was taught to try to be identical to one another. So they wore similar clothes, they had the same haircut, they ate alike, they had matching smiles! they even got married among them so they could preserve their own features! For long time she wondered if this kind of life made sense to her but she was afraid to ask because according to the leaders those who dont follow the rules would fall into affliction and bad luck. But still, little by little Azul started to make herself different to the others. Although the residents of Only hadnt realized of her changes, she started to talk about it to her family and close friends. They couldnt believe her words and thought it was a great tragedy! She felt rejected,  I feel I dont belong here any more she pondered. One day the village leaders heard about Azul wanting to change the rules!!! Then, the news were spread all over town! Many people went to see her and tell her she was making a big mistake! Azul answered: ""Im just different to you all!. They threatened her saying that she would be isolated in a house out of town where she would be visited and fed once in a while!! She was not a good example for the inhabitants of Only ! When she saw such a big trouble she went desperate, sad and scared so she ran away to the woods. On her way she fell in the middle of the forest. Suddenly she felt something was bringing her up. She realized there was a giant flower growing up from below her. She was still in awe when she noticed many people of town were pointing at her. Azul felt ashamed so she covered her face with a hand and raised up the other towards the sky as if she was asking for mercy or help. Unexpectedly she felt that another hand was grabbing hers and pulling her up to the sky before the astonished reaction of every one who was there. When she was in the clouds she perceived everything shiny white so she closed her eyes, then she heard a voice saying: Azul, you love your people and your people loves you, love will overcome all obstacles among you Then she opened her eyes and there she was in her bed...it was 6 am. Afterwards, she took courage to tell everything to the people of her tiny little village.but Azul saw them through eyes of love knowing that they loved her back. She left town some days later and discovered other places, other ways of life, different paths that she never imagined they existed She was totally accepted! But she always loved that people she grew up with. They were always her friends and love overcame every difference between them. "

Located near Salisbury in the beautiful Wiltshire countryside, it is a highlight of the South West. The true meaning of this ancient, awe-inspiring creation has been lost in the mists of time. Was Stonehenge a temple for sun worship, a healing centre, a burial site or perhaps a huge calendar? How did our ancestors manage to carry the mighty stones from so far away and then, using only the most primitive of tools, build this amazing structure? Surrounded by mystery, Stonehenge never fails to impress Stonehenge private access tours. (The Stonehenge Tour Company)  www.StonehengeTours.com"

I felt such awe as he looked right at me, made motions of communicating (if only there were mics and speakers to hear their sounds), then came right up to me agains the glass where my hand was touching the glass and leaned his head into it, while looking at me. It made me a bit emotional, feeling some sort of connection. He swam back around a few more times, acknowledging me, before he ran off to play.  Jack is a rescue that couldn't be released back into the wild, as both he and Daisy - the second porpoise there - were rescued when they were little."

The annual Longwood Gardens Christmas never fails to awe the visitors with one spectacular display after another.  Whether these are in the magnificently elegant grand Conservatory, or outdoors within the over 1,000 acres of fabulous grounds, each and every thing is meticulously planned and designed, always arriving at some fresh ideas and/or concepts, while also maintaining the traditionally classic holiday floral and lighting appointments throughout.

The Ochi family held the castle into the late Sengoku Period and it was abandoned in 1580. However, Toyotomi Hideyoshis half-brother, Hidenaga, was given control of the region and ordered Tsutsui Junkei to begin transforming the abandoned fort into a modern castle. Junkei started in 1584, but soon died and his heir was transferred to a new fief a year later. The new castellan became Honda Tarozaemon, and together with his son, finished turning the castle into a massive and beautiful fortress containing 27 turrets (5 of which were in the tamon style), 9 bridges, and massive stone walls that still shock and awe to this day. In 1640 stewardship of the castle was given to Uemura Iemasa and his descendents ruled the castle and its domain until the end of the feudal period. The castle was ordered abandoned in 1873 by the imperial government and subsequently dismantled.ed."

Access to the Castle is sometimes restricted by higher-than-usual levels of water in the Loch, at which times the site effectively becomes a temporary island. The Castle was built in about 1450 by Sir Colin Campbell, first Lord of Glenorchy, as a five storey tower house with a courtyard defended by an outer wall.  By about 1500 an additional range and a hall had been added to the south side of the castle. Further buildings went up during the 16th and 17th centuries.  Kilchurn was on a small island in Loch Awe scarcely larger than the castle itself, although it is now connected to the mainland as the water level was altered in 1817.  The Castle would have been accessed via an underwater or low lying causeway."

Enchanting enough in itself, but also an important place, because this was the home church of Ernest Geldart, one of the most important church artists of the last twenty years of the 19th Century.   He was vicar here 1883-1900, so he had the opportunity to create a church which was entirely his, to his fashion and philosophy. He did this with no expenses barred, a fabulous confection of the pre-Raphaelite and proto-Art Nouveau.   Every surface is painted, every wooden object is gilded, there are statues and stained glass and every thing, an absolute treasure house.   Open every day, it makes a mockery of churches which are kept locked. It is awe-inspiring, if not perhaps quite to the modern taste, and went immediately into my Essex Top 20.

This image is comprised of 142 x 30 second exposures stacked and edited in Photoshop CS6!  I thought i would make a cameo appearance in this one!  About Terris Novalis: This work consists of two measuring instruments; a theodolite and an engineer's level, faithfully reproduced an incredible twenty times life size, standing approximately six metres tall. Made from stainless steel and supported on animal feet, this awe inspiring work is visible for many miles and stands as a monument to the history of the area and a prominent mile marker for the C2C cycle route. The animal feet that hold these instruments aloft were inspired by symbolic heraldry found on shields, coats of arms, plaques and similar items associated with land and ownership. Included are a bird of prey, a horse lion, crocodile, cow and a primate's hand. Cast in solid stainless steel, from originals carved by Tony Cragg, these large feet are both beautiful and at the same time, daunting. The work sited at Consett, marks the watershed between the upland / moorland landscape and the extremes of the Industrial Age. Built on the Stanhope and Tyne Railway Line - the earliest commercial railway in Britain - Terris Novalis marks what was once Europe's largest steel works. Local people see this landmark as a monument to the scale of local industry and its demise - the tragedy that has followed."

The Rckenfigur, or the back figure, is a term that came to be during the romantic period, where nature was idealised and worshiped by many artists of the time. The Rckenfigur symbolises the small human presence amid the expansive natural landscapes. It creates a sense of awe towards the natural scene, and a sense of mystery towards what the person is feeling or thinking. This is what I wanted to achieve in this series. The figure encourages you as a viewer to place yourself in his position, and to reflect over the nature perceived by humans."

It was built on the site of an earlier fishing village in the mid 1700s by the 3rd Duke of Argyll, Chief of the powerful Clan Campbell. He demolished the original village to give his rebuilt castle more space, and rehoused the population in a new town that is one of the most attractive in Scotland.      Front Street   The George Hotel   Inveraray Woollen Mill   Glenaray and Inveraray Parish Church   South Main Street   Inveraray Jail    Loch Fyne Whiskies    The original village of Inveraray stood in the parkland that now extends south east from Inveraray Castle to the main A83. It had grown following the move of the Campbells to ""old"" Inveraray Castle in the mid 1400s from their previous stronghold at Innis Chonnell Castle on an island in Loch Awe.    Inveraray Cross   The Duke's Tower   Inveraray Castle   Inveraray Maritime Museum   The Arctic Penguin    Inveraray was well enough established to become a burgh of barony in 1472 and a royal burgh in 1648. With a good natural harbour and lying at a key focal point in the limited road network across Argyll, it had effectively become the legal and administrative centre for the county by the early 1700s. Its development went hand in hand with the growing power of the Campbells and the importance of their seat at Inveraray Castle.   The idea of replacing the 1400s tower house with a modern residence befitting the status and power of the Dukes of Argyll first occurred to the 2nd Duke in 1720. When the 3rd Duke of Argyll succeeded to his title in 1743 he commissioned an architect, and work began in 1745. As part of the project he created open parkland by demolishing the existing village of Inveraray, which stood between the castle and the sea.   The new town of Inveraray was built on a site to the south than its predecessor, out of sight of the castle. What emerged was an exceptionally attractive town. This had two main elements. Firstly, Front Street ran almost west from the harbour to a large inn placed near the gates to the park for Inveraray Castle. And secondly, the very grand Main Street ran parallel with the shore of Loch Fyne and at right angles to Front Street.   This comprised large white-harled buildings on both sides while in its centre it bulged out into Church Square to accommodate the classical bulk of the Glenaray and Inveraray Parish Church, built between 1792 and 1802 by Robert Mylne. This was originally built as a double church, with one half worshipping in Gaelic while the other half worshipped in Scots.   Because of the size and grandeur of the buildings lining its main streets, Inveraray can appear to be a much larger settlement than it actually is. In practice it is little larger than what you see as you drive through. The area between Main Street and Loch Fyne is a warren of small streets, but a large part of it is occupied by Inveraray Jail. To the west, Main Street backs onto The Avenue, now the village's main car park.   To the west again is a scatter of more recent housing, but the original vision of Inveraray is still obvious on the ground, and it is probably one of the most original, complete and unaltered settlements you are likely to find anywhere in Scotland. Also to the west of The Avenue is All Saints Church, built in 1886. Between 1923 and 1931 this had added to it the freestanding 38m high Duke's Tower. This was built as a war memorial and accommodates a ring of 10 bells, reputedly the second heaviest peal in the world. The views from the top of the Tower are outstanding.   Inveraray Jail dates back to the 1820. The Georgian courthouse and grim prison blocks closed in the 1889, but in more recent times have re-opened as an imaginative visitor centre and museum. Not far to the south of Inveraray Jail and on the shore is the unassuming Para Handy Cottage, the birthplace of the author (of, amongst other things, the Para Handy stories) Neil Munro.   Inveraray's Front Street and harbourside are both fascinating and unusually attractive. On the harbourside is Inveraray Cross, a tall and beautifully carved stone cross dating back to the 1300s or 1400s and once serving as the market cross of the original village (albeit in a different location). Moored at the town pier is the Arctic Penguin, a triple-masted schooner built in Dublin in 1911. Together with the steamer The Vital Spark this forms the Inveraray Maritime Museum. "

The art of controlled growth is rather incredible, and the ones here are no exception, many of which are around the century mark in age.  The single pomegranate on this one certainly captures the attention of the visitors. We wanted to share our experience of the visit to Longwood Gardens 2014 Christmas Spectacular (the main theme this year is BIRDS).  The festivities begin on Thanksgiving Day and continue through the end of the first week of 2015.  In recent years, we have found that it works perfectly for us to go on Thanksgiving Day, for we would celebrate TG early and afterward.  This allows an opening day attendance at Longwood, where the crowd is significantly less than during the peak weekend days.  There will be a good number of photos to view, and for the most part, presented in correct sequence.  Please check out our ALBUMS titled LONGWOOD GARDENS of Kennett Square, PA and/or CHRISTMAS SCENES for a better flow in exploring the photos, since the continuity is lost when uploading into FLICKR while many others are doing the same, thus, having a variety of shots mixed in between the ones representing our visit on this day.    The wide variety of flowers and plants at Longwood Gardens are absolutely stunning in all stages and species . . . truly a Garden of Eden for anyone with a deep passion for these gifts of nature.  The annual Longwood Gardens Christmas never fails to awe the visitors with one spectacular display after another.  Whether these are in the magnificently elegant grand Conservatory, or outdoors within the over 1,000 acres of fabulous grounds, each and every thing is meticulously planned and designed, always arriving at some fresh ideas and/or concepts, while also maintaining the traditionally classic holiday floral and lighting appointments throughout.  Given that the main theme for the 2014 holiday season is BIRDS, this can be seen in such spectacularly tasteful fashion throughout the displays of the vast indoor landscape.  From the moment one enters the architectural marvel of the Conservatory, whether through the main Orangery or the East Conservatory, an awe inspiring view awaits. "

It is located on the north bank of the River Liffey, on Custom House Quay between Butt Bridge and Talbot Memorial Bridge.  The building of a new Custom House for Dublin was the idea of John Beresford, who became first commissioner of revenue for Ireland in 1780. In 1781 he appointed James Gandon as architect, after Thomas Cooley, the original architect on the project, had died. This was Gandon's first large scale commission. The new Custom House was unpopular with the Dublin Corporation and some city merchants who complained that it moved the axis of the city, would leave little room for shipping, and it was being built on what at the time was a swamp. Purchase of land was delayed and proved exorbitant and the laying of foundations was disrupted by the High Sheriff and members of the Dublin Corporation with a mob of several thousand. However, Beresford was determined to complete the project and ignored the protests."

Situated about 150km north east of Seville and with a current population of just over 300,000,  Cordoba was founded by the Romans at the highest navigable point on the Guadalquivir River.  For that reason it became a port  of great importance, used for shipping Spanish olive oil, wine and wheat back to Ancient Rome. The Romans built the mighty bridge crossing the river, now called ""El Puente Romano"". But Cordoba's hour of greatest glory was when it became the capital of the Moorish kingdom of El-Andalus, and this was when work began on the Great Mosque, or ""Mezquita"", which  after several centuries of additions and enlargements  became one of the largest in all of Islam. When the city was reconquered by the Christians in 1236, the new rulers of the city were so awed by its beauty that they left it standing, building their cathedral in the midst of its rows of arches and columns, and creating the extraordinary church-mosque that we see today. As well as the unique mosque-cathedral, Cordoba's treasures include the Alcazar, or Fortress, built by the Christians in 1328; the Calahorra Fort, originally built by the Arabs, which guards the Roman Bridge, on the far side of the river from the Mezquita, and the ancient Jewish Synagogue, now a museum."

I tend to use my macro lens a lot its my favourite, but well, on a trip I jump from the macro to the zoom. My cameras have always been Nikon, and these were taken with a D80. These photos were taken on my second trip to India, almost 20 years after the first one, and some of these photographs will be part of an exhibit soon. Their names and info, plus many more photos are on my site. Youre welcome to visit it. Which are your favourites?

Me encanta encontrar momentos hermosos tal y como son, sin interferir en ellos, sin usar filtros, retoques, manipulacin y usando slo la luz disponible. Mi cmara y mis lentes son lo que un pincel y pintura para un pintor: son herramientas que uso para mostrar lo que veo, mi visin del mundo. Nunca soy ms feliz que cuando estoy tomando fotos. Entonces me olvido que me romp la espalda (s, puedo caminar), que hay cosas que me preocupan, que algunas cosas no son como debieran. Cuando tomo fotos, la vida es perfecta, y todo me sorprende hasta conmoverme. Tendo a usar mucho mi macro es mi lente favorito, pero en un viaje siempre voy del macro al zoom y cambio mucho de lentes. Siempre he tenido cmaras Nikon, y estas fotos fueron tomadas con una D80. Estas fotos fueron tomadas en mi segundo viaje a India, casi 20 aos despus del primero, y algunas de estas imgenes sern parte de una exhibicin muy pronto.

Her husband was away at the time - he was a much travelled man, visiting Rome three times and made Knight of Rhodes to boot.  This original 5-storey keep, later extensively improved and extended, was to be well-tested in battle - for instance, enduring a siege by Royalists during the Civil War. Later, although by now already a partial ruin, it was used to garrison Hanoverian troops in the tumultuous days of the Jacobite Risings. Subsequently, as the Breadalbanes looked increasingly towards Perthshire, it lost all domestic and military importance and even, in 1770, its roof as well! It is said that some of the slates and timbers were used locally - at Craig Lodge, for example, which was built as a hunting lodge. "

Kilchurn Castle was built in about 1450 by Sir Colin Campbell, first Lord of Glenorchy, as a five storey tower house with a courtyard defended by an outer wall. By about 1500 an additional range and a hall had been added to the south side of the castle. Further buildings went up during the 16th and 17th centuries. Kilchurn was on a small island in Loch Awe scarcely larger than the castle itself, although it is now connected to the mainland as the water level was altered in 1817. The castle would have been accessed via an underwater or low lying causeway. At the turn of the 16th century Kilchurn Castle was extended by Sir Duncan Campbell with the addition of a single storey dining hall built along the inside of the south curtain. During the second half of the century, another Sir Colin Campbell, the 6th Laird, continued to improve the castle's accommodation by adding some chambers to the north of the tower house, and remodelling the parapet. This included the introduction of the circular corner turrets adorned by corbels, most of which have survived remarkably well. Towards the end of the 16th century the Clan MacGregor of Glenstrae were occupying the castle. Once owning the lands of Glenorchy during the 14th century, until they passed through marriage to the Campbells, the MacGregors were appointed keepers to Kilchurn Castle as the Campbells spent much of their time at Fincharn. This arrangement lasted until the very early part of the 17th century, when a violent feud between the two families brought it to an end and the Campbells retook possession. In 1681, Sir John Campbell of Glenorchy was made 1st Earl of Breadalbane. To take advantage of the turbulence of the times, he converted Kilchurn into a modern barracks, capable of housing 200 troops. His main addition was the three storey L-shaped block along the north side.   Engraving of Kilchurn Castle by William Miller, 1846 Kilchurn was then used as a Government garrison during the 1715 and 1745 Jacobite risings. The Campbells attempted, unsuccessfully, to sell Kilchurn to the government, after they moved in 1740 to Taymouth Castle in Perthshire. In 1760, the castle was badly damaged by lightning and was completely abandoned; the remains of a turret of a tower, still resting upside-down in the centre of the courtyard, attest to the violence of the storm. William Turner's watercolour Midday depicts the castle amidst the weather conditions and the geology of Scotland. It was created in 1802. The ruin is currently in the care of Historic Scotland, and is open to the public during the summer. Access, during summer only, is by either by boat from Lochawe pier, or on foot from Dalmally. Both points are on the A85 road. During 2006 and 2007 there was an access problem to the castle. Network Rail, in accordance with their policy of blocking foot crossings on railway lines, closed the crossing to Kilchurn, effectively removing land access. However in 2007 access via the nearby viaduct was created, restoring landward access once more."

awe,http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3858/14967216515_cdcc03229b_z.jpg,2,3,"XI: Mary Magdalene: Mary holds her long hair ready to anoint Christ's feet. Probably not from this window originally. St Peter and St Paul, East Harling, Norfolk  With its aisles, clerestory, porch and chancel, St Peter and St Paul is a textbook example of its century, although there are a number of curiosities that add even more interest. The vestry on the north side of the chancel, for example, which was once a shrine chapel, retains its image niche on its eastern face. And there are more image niches, these with elaborate foliage pedestals, in the buttresses of the tower; everything is topped off by a lead and timber fleche which was apparently the model for the one at St Peter Mancroft in Norwich, a church which has several features in common with this one.  The tower is a delight, the buttressing and pinnacles exactly in proportion to make it appear to rise like a fairy castle from the ground. The south porch, by contrast, is, despite its flushwork, rather austere, a result of its rebuilding early in the 19th century before the ecclesiological movement took hold. All in all, this is as good as 15th century rebuilding gets, the money coming thanks to Anne Harling having no less than three husbands who all wanted to spend as little time in purgatory as possible.  You step down into a wide space which, on a dull day, can be rather gloomy. Although inevitably heavily restored by the Victorians, St Peter and St Paul does not have that depressingly anonymous urban feel you so often find in churches of this size. This is partly because the beautiful parclose screen in the south aisle partitions off so much space, creating a sense of rooms within rooms, altering the way your eyes are inevitably drawn to the east. The rood screen must have been vast here; its dado survives at the west end, a deeply traceried affair with its features presented in carving rather than painting.  When the rood screen was in its proper place, to move from the nave into the chancel must have been like stepping from darkness into light. This is because of the feature that makes East Harling famous, the vast east window with its 15th century glass. After St Peter Mancroft it is the best collection in Norfolk. Unusually, the provenance of the glass is fairly well-documented: we can be fairly certain that it came from this church originally. Still present after the Reformation, it was removed by the Harling family to the Hall in the early 17th century. They may have been Laudians wanting to preserve it from the intentions of the puritans, or merely thought it would look nice in their dining hall; whatever, we know that shortly before Francis Blomefield visited here in the 1730s it was returned to the church and set in its present configuration.  In 1939, when war threatened, it was removed again, being reset just before Cautley visited in the early 1950s. There are parts of at least three sequences here, two of which were almost certainly in the east window originally, and one which almost certainly wasn't.  Essentially, the window contains two rosary sequences; the Joyful Mysteries of the Blessed Virgin, which include the Annunciation, the Nativity and the Assumption, and the Sorrowful Mysteries of the Blessed Virgin, which include the Crucifixion and the Deposition. However, this is open to interpretation, as we shall see. There is also the figure of St Mary Magdalene, which may once have been associated with a nave altar, and would have been located in a window there.  The five lights contain four rows of panels, making twenty altogether.  Top row: I. Annunciation: Mary at her prayer desk. Gabriel, crowned and haloed, with a sceptre of lilies, kneels in supplication. II. Visitation: Elizabeth, hooded to show her age, places her hand on Mary's pregnant belly. III. Nativity: Two midwives look on. The infant in the manger is rayed; a horned cow gazes in awe. IV. Adoration of the Shepherds: One holds a lamb, one plays pipes. A third appears to offer a fleece. V. Adoration of the Magi: Two of the wise men gauge each others' reactions as the third offers his gift.  Second row: VI: collection of fragments. VII: Presentation in the Temple: Joseph carries the doves, Mary offers the child to Simeon. Anna is not shown. VIII: The Finding in the Temple: Head covered, Mary bursts in among the men to find her son teaching. IX: The Wedding at Canaa: Christ, seated at the top table, blesses a chicken and a ham. Mary directs the servant. X: collection of fragments.  Third row: XI: Mary of Magdala: Mary holds her long hair ready to anoint Christ's feet. Probably not from this window originally. XII: The Betrayal at Gethsemane: Judas kisses Christ; Peter cuts off the ear of the high priest's servant. XIII: Crucifixion: Mary swoons in John's arms. XIV: Deposition from the cross: The pieta. Tears spring from Mary's eyes. XV: Assumption of the Blessed Virgin: Mary is assumed bodily into heaven.  Bottom row: XVI: Donor: Probably Robert Wingfield, second husband of Anne Harling. XVII: Resurrection: Christ steps fully clothed from the tomb. Unusually, the soldiers are awake. XVIII: Ascension of Christ: Mary, surrounded by disciples, watches as her son ascends to heaven. XIX: Descent of the Holy Spirit: Mary, surrounded by disciples, receives the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. XX: Donor: Probably William Chamberlain, first husband of Anne Harling.  Nowadays, we tend to think of the rosary as consisting of three sequences of five mysteries each, but in the late middle ages things were much more flexible, and rosary sequences often consisted of seven mysteries. The Glorious Mysteries sequence, of which the Assumption is now a part, is a later development, and the two adorations shown here are subsumed into a single mystery. There are a couple of images here that don't quite fit; the Wedding at Canaa is obviously a Marian text, and yet is not traditionally a rosary subject. Similarly the Betrayal, the only one of the images not to feature Mary. I wonder if what we have here are parts of two separate sequences, a Marian sequence of mysteries (I-V, VII-IX, XV), and a Passion sequence (XII-XIV, XVII-XIX). They are both clearly the work of the same workshop, and Mary is always shown with the same face and dress, but this would not preclude them from being two sequences.  Why were they here at all? We need to get away from thinking of such things as a 'poor man's bible', the need for which was superseded at the Reformation. These were devotional objects, designed to be used as meditations while praying and saying the rosary. They were created in the 15th century, a time when the mind of the Church was fiercely concentrated on asserting orthodox Catholic doctrine in the face of local superstitions and abuses. As such, they were anathema to the reformers, and were later elsewhere destroyed for being superstitious, not for being superfluous. An 18th century antiquarian mind, ignorant of the nature of Catholic devotion, might easily mix the two sequences into historical order, and possibly misunderstand the Assumption (obviously, as Mary reappears two images on at the Ascension, it is out of order). I wonder what they thought it was?  A couple of other things about the east window that you shouldn't miss. Firstly, everywhere you look there are tiny baskets - Mortlock calls them 'frails', and tells us that they were simple rush baskets used by workmen to carry tools. Also, though not in such profusion, there are bodices. These symbols are repeated elsewhere in the church in stone on tombs, and as such must be symbols of the Harling family.  Another symbol is high up on the north side, a red squirrel. Curiously, this also appears in the painting A Lady with a Squirrel and a Starling by Hans Holbein, now thought to be a portrait of Anne Lovell - the squirrel is a symbol of the Lovell family, who took over the local manor here from the Harlings in the 16th century, and the starling represents Ea- well, you guess.  In July 2006, Chris Harrison and I came across  some more glass from East Harling  in the Norfolk County Archaeologist Service archive at Gressenhall. It was probably removed from the church for safety in 1939, and then not replaced, possibly ending up at the museum of church art in Norwich at St Peter Hungate, disappearing into storage when that closed in 1993. It depicts a Bishop and Christ seated in Majesty, and the lozenges in between carry the telltale frails and bodices familiar from other glass within the church.  Within the screen is a large chapel, containing two major tombs. One is in alabaster, an early 17th century memorial to Sir Thomas and Lady Alice Lovell (remember the squirrel?) who died in 1604. The piece is good - too good, its 1950s restoration gives it a Festival of Britain air. Their symbols lie at their feet - his a magnificent peacock, hers a gruesome Saracen scalp held aloft.  The other appears to be a composite. It lies to the east, and the two effigies are clearly not from this tomb; they simply don't fit. They are supposed to be Robert Harling, died Paris in 1435, and his wife Dame Joan. Neither are buried here - she is at Rushford near Thetford, he is in some corner of a foreign field that is forever French schoolchildren on picnics excitedly tugging old thighbones from the soil - but in any case it is the trimmings of the tomb rather than the effigies that are most of interest, including a pelican in her piety and one that is almost a lily crucifix.  On the north side of the chancel is a fine tomb with brass inlays - the brasses now gone. Not as magnificent as either of the two previously mentioned, it is actually the most significant, as this is where you'll find Anne Harling, wife of the serial rebuilders of this church. Look out for those flails again.  What more? 17th century Lovells (remember the squirrel) have in-yer-face memorials either side of the sanctuary - that to the north curiously with no inscription. There are hatchments, remains of a wallpainting that are too indistinct to interpret (but may be seven works of mercy), a good set of royal arms, medieval heads, curious 19th century bench ends of a lion and a wild man, heraldic misericords, a Dec font - well, come and see for yourself. You know you want to."

NGC 1566 is an intermediate spiral galaxy, meaning that while it does not have a well defined bar-shaped region of stars at its centre  like barred spirals  it is not quite an unbarred spiral either (heic9902o). The small but extremely bright nucleus of NGC 1566 is clearly visible in this image, a telltale sign of its membership of the Seyfert class of galaxies. The centres of such galaxies are very active and luminous, emitting strong bursts of radiation and potentially harbouring supermassive black holes that are many millions of times the mass of the Sun. NGC 1566 is not just any Seyfert galaxy; it is the second brightest Seyfert galaxy known. It is also the brightest and most dominant member of the Dorado Group, a loose concentration of galaxies that together comprise one of the richest galaxy groups of the southern hemisphere. This image highlights the beauty and awe-inspiring nature of this unique galaxy group, with NGC 1566 glittering and glowing, its bright nucleus framed by swirling and symmetrical lavender arms.

Unfortunately, access to these geoglyphs is restricted by lack of roads, making a walking trek necessary to view them. There are over 5,000 prehistoric geoglyphs in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile, and like the Nazca lines of Peru, they are mysterious, beautiful and awe-inspiring.  Although we can't know the entire reason they were built, researcher Luis Briones believes they are part sign post and part story-telling along a transportation network connecting the South American civilizations in combined commercial and religious travel led by caravans of llamas.     www.nazcamystery.com/atacama.htm"

This percent is from 19 to 22, according to the season of the year, andcalculations fix the total of the salt in the lake at four hundredmillion tons. The waters are sluggish and green-hued. Theyare very buoyant, and so clear that the eye can penetrate them togreat depths.

If those who spend so many hours in idle company, light reading, and useless pastimes, could learn wisdom, they would find more profitable society and more interesting engagements in meditation than in the vanities which now have such charms for them. We should all know more, live nearer to God, and grow in grace, if we were more alone. Meditation chews the cud and extracts the real nutriment from the mental food gathered elsewhere. When Jesus is the theme, meditation is sweet indeed. Isaac found Rebecca while engaged in private musings; many others have found their best beloved there.  Very admirable was the choice of place. In the field we have a study hung round with texts for thought. From the cedar to the hyssop, from the soaring eagle down to the chirping grasshopper, from the blue expanse of heaven to a drop of dew, all things are full of teaching, and when the eye is divinely opened, that teaching flashes upon the mind far more vividly than from written books. Our little rooms are neither so healthy, so suggestive, so agreeable, or so inspiring as the fields. Let us count nothing common or unclean, but feel that all created things point to their Maker, and the field will at once be hallowed.  Very admirable was the season. The season of sunset as it draws a veil over the day, befits that repose of the soul when earthborn cares yield to the joys of heavenly communion. The glory of the setting sun excites our wonder, and the solemnity of approaching night awakens our awe. If the business of this day will permit it, it will be well, dear reader, if you can spare an hour to walk in the field at eventide, but if not, the Lord is in the town too, and will meet with thee in thy chamber or in the crowded street. Let thy heart go forth to meet Him.  Credits: Commentary Inspired by C.H.

View larger + F11  .   Leh Palace Part dilapidated, but under restoration, the towering nine-storey Palace, former royal residence, awes all. Influenced by early dzong fortresses in Tibet, it in turn became precedent model for the Potala at Lhasa. Ladakhi's greatest king, Sengge (Lion) Namgyal built it at the beginning of the 17th C, though it was later damaged by invaders, forcing the Ladakhi royal family to move to Stok. Perched up, the castle's stark facade, dun coloured like the surrounding terrain, seems as one with the rocky landscape, its soaring walls tapering a little to give stability. The walls were constructed following the traditional system adapted across the Himalayas of alternating stone with timber. The Palace's lower heavy walls are built of dressed stones with a layer of timber bonding every 3m. The Palace's upper walls are constructed of mud bricks. The palace of the ""Lion King"" was not only a royal fortress but was surrounded by a circuit of buildings that was also fortified. Although the buildings served different functions the contiguous blank outer facades were loopholed and provided additional defences. Buddhist shrines, and today museum facilities, are incorporated in the large structure. One recently-restored temple preceded the Palace, though not much of the ancient material survived. Above the incorporated gompas in the Palace, the fourth and fifth floors formed the royal residence and main hall where the king held court. On the sixth floor is the throne room and another small temple. It was all once grandly decorated but is now mainly bare. Recessed terraces and projecting balconies provide wonderful views over the town and spectacular landscape.  ........  ""The fortress palace of Sengge Namgyal at Leh: The finest secular building in Ladakh was built in Leh in the mid 1630s by Sengge Namgyal as his palace. Built, like the palaces at Shey and Basgo, at the southern end of a mountain spur it looms over and dominates the town that lies at its foot. The rectangular palace is nine storeys tall and has the aura of a fortress, although it has served as the palace of the royal family until recent times.     Why Sengge built his palace here is open to speculation. Certainly Shey is a more strategic site and had been strongly fortified long before Leh received its city wall. It has been postulated that towards the end of Sengge's reign Leh's position as a long trading town had eclipsed all the other towns in the Indus valley, particularly Shey. In addition there was a comparatively peaceful environment. This mighty palace exudes power even now, and remains a visual statement of the wealth of Ladakh's most famous king.     Built of well-coursed field stone in a mud mortar., the palace is nine storeys tall on its south and eastern aspect with the lower two storeys devoid of any external openings. Measuring approx 100 by 50m (330 by 165 ft) the solitary entrance is via a porticoed doorway into its eastern wall. All four walls slope inward and are massively buttressed. The openings at each floor level are arranged one above another. Those at the lowest levels are very narrow, little more than loopholes but increase in size as the floors rise; many of the window-sized openings of the top four storeys are provided with wooden balconies. Nearly all the openings face east with a few to the south. Both these sides are surrounded by buildings of two to four storeys, rising up in tiers from the town. They appear contemporaneous with the fortress palace and almost all of their outer facades are blank apart from narrow loophole-type openings. Like all buildings in Ladakh they are flat roofed.     The architect and architectural precedents are unknown; certainly no other secular building rises to the same height and it is rivalled in its enormity only by one or two of the largest valley monasteries. The palace is recorded as being built in three years and completed a number of years before the king's death. Thus it pre-dates the Potala Palace, Lhasa. (PH)    "

It's not only the closest spire to camp, but the approach doesn't involve glacier travel and the route is a mellow class 4 scramble with little exposure. Since we didn't know what to expect or how comfortable we would feel we brought our rack and a single rope. We ended up scrambling easily up the spire with no route finding problems. We never needed any gear on the way up, but since we had a rope we chose to rappel off the summit. The anchors were spanking new, and not mentioned in the guidebook for obvious reasons. Here is Alana rapping off the summit.   The Bugaboos - August 12-18, 2012  Living in Squamish I am very lucky to be surrounded by excellent rock to train my technical climbing skills as well as many great peaks for scrambling. But, until last week I had never had the opportunity to combine the two skills I've been developing for years. That all changed when a friend invited me to be her partner on the yearly trip my friend group takes. Two months after the invitiation, a partner swap, and a week of careful packing and preparation I actually found myself driving east about to embark on what would be the greatest adventure of my life to date.  The moment I arrived at basecamp my lofty climbing aspiration were downgraded to starting with a 4th class route and going from there. I received tons of advice from friends that had been going for several years, but still nothing could have prepared me for the reality of being there. The ascent to Applebee basecamp, the scale of the spires, the difficulty of the glaciers, and the exposure did not translate well to maps and photos I found myself in awe and terror. Every single obstacle I encountered was more physically and mentally demanding that I could have expected.  Even though we were with a large group of friends, we were on our own when we headed out for the day and often learning as we went. As a result we learned many lessons the hard way, including when to put crampons on, when to switch into rock shoes, how hard preventing rockfall can be, and all the ways rappelling can go wrong.  It was both the single most terrifying and rewarding experience of my life. Never did I expect to learn so much in a week, or do so little actual climbing. Instead it was a wild ride of alpine obstacles, and a truly life changing experience shared with great friends old and new.  A brief summary of my adventure:  Aug 12 - Hike into Applebee base camp with 80+lbs pack full of climbing, camping, and glacier gear as well as 7 days of food, and clothes for everything from -10 to +30 degrees celcius rain and shine. Aug 13 - Eastpost spire, combination of Northeast and Northwest ridges. Aug 14 - Crescent Spire, W ridge. - Rained off first attempt, after self arresting and improv. anchor construction. Aug 15 - Crescent Spire, W ridge - Successful ascent followed by rappelling disaster involving ditching a rope that was later recovered Aug 16 - Pigeon Spire, W ridge - Got 30m up route then turned back to save terror management skills for descent back down the Bugaboo-Snowpatch col Aug 17 - Eastpost spire again and bathing in the tarn Aug 18 - Hike out and long drive home  Please feel free to contact me with any questions regarding my experience.

One of the three units of the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument, the crown jewels of this region with their spectacular colors and sublime patterns that seem to have been hand-painted by the master stroke of Mother Natures brush.  We reached the unit in the late afternoon, but it was foggy in some part and heavy dark clouds in some areas. It wasn't in it's full colours yet as it was spring time. I wish I went with my photographer friends, unfortunately I am the only photographer. It wasn't easy when some of us in the vehicle are sort of in a hurry. But like on a painters palette, the colors shift and change with the difference of light, weather and the seasons.  Every rainstorm intensifies the bands of red and orange, the generous splashes of yellow and gold, and the random streaks of black and grey leaving you speechless and awe struck. Between April and May, rivers of small yellow flowers run down within the cracks of the reddish hills forming golden pools to their feet  a magic sight that draws hundreds of landscape photographers and artists to the place. But no matter what the time of year, the shapes and colors of the Painted Hills are an incredible sight.  One thing for sure, this is definitely one of a kind experience, the country roads we travelled winds through rugged landscapes passing agricultural fields of grass and clover and leads into a geological wonderland. I for sure will come back here...

I could head back to Bures from there.   The rain stayed off, but the amount of surface water was now a problem - I have mudguards, but some roads were flooded, and although cars were rare around here it would only take one overtaking carelessly to soak me. Without incident I entered Pebmarsh, which turned out to be a largish, long village, and in the oldest part of it I reached the church.  Open. This church is quite different from the others I had visited so far. They were all, in their way, typical small Essex churches. Pebmarsh is a typical large East Anglian church. It is BIG. It has aisles and a clerestory, and castellated walls, so would be quite at home in west Suffolk or south-east Cambridgeshire. To give it an Essex signature it has a perky wooden turret at the top of the tower as at Finchingfield and Felsted.   I don't know of a church more difficult to photograph from the south; it sits within a wide bend, hard against the churchyard wall and high above the village street. The best I could do was to wander down the street opposite, but trees and a telegraph pole quickly impeded the view.  Inside, it is like the bones of a church: the considerable 19th Century restoration stripped the plaster from the walls, exposing the flints internally as at Hildersham in Cambridgeshire.  It is rather striking, as you may imagine.  There is good 19th and 20th Century glass, as well as some 13th century survivals including a figure of St Peter holding his keys at a jaunty angle, but the star of the show here is the 1330s brass to Sir William Fitzralph, generally considered the most important brass in Essex, and one of the earliest martial brasses in England. I'm not a great one for brasses, but it is pretty awe-inspiring."

The waterfalls in the mid-Blue Mountains dont receive as much publicity as the better known waterfalls in the upper Blue Mountains. Certainly, the waterfalls around Katoomba, Blackheath & Wentworth Falls are larger & more spectacular.  Also, these areas are home to awe-inspiring views, imposing clifflines, and majestic valleys like the Jamison & the Grose Valleys.  The mid mountains landscape is more intimate, but there are some hidden gems to be found around the rainforests of Lawson & Hazelbrook. Note: If youre a keen photographer you should visit these waterfalls after decent rain. Warning: some of these are rough tracks with slippery rocks so watch your footing & wear decent walking shoes or boots.     Hazelbrook is home to the well-known & much photographed Terrace Falls on the south side of the township. The Terrace Falls reserve is a short walk of a few kms through lovely rainforest & contains three waterfalls. Its possible to make this into a more interesting circuit walk by turning left at the junction with Bedford Creek. From there a short walk brings you to Bedford Pool - here you turn left & follow an un-named creek up a gully. This track contains a few cascades and brings you to Pyramid Falls & an orphan pagoda at the head of the gully. Its quite unusual to find rock pagodas in this area. From here you follow one of a couple of fire-trails back to where you started from.  For experienced walkers only: The Terrace Falls track can be combined with the South Lawson waterfall walk to provide a feast of waterfalls. Turn right at the bottom of the Terrace Falls track, follow Bedford Creek to Willawong Pool, then turn right into Lawson Creek. From there its approx. a 1.5km off-track bush-bash to reach the Sth Lawson reserve with lots of rock-hopping involved & creek crossings. Allow half a day for this circuit (or a full day if youre a serious photographer). Note: There is a fire-trail that can be used to combine these two walks, but its quite boring walking in my opinion, though much quicker.   The South Lawson waterfall reserve is an easy 3km walk that contains four waterfalls & takes you through some varied vegetation. This reserve features: Junction, Cataract, Adelina & Federal Falls.  On the north side of Lawson is the pretty Dantes Glen, Lucys Glen, & Empire Pass tracks which are among the best walks in this area. Dantes Glen has a certain ambience to it with lovely rainforest & is home to three waterfalls including Fairy Falls. Its possible to combine Dantes Glen with Empire Pass to make a great circuit walk of around 7-8kms, through a quite pristine area.  Northern Hazelbrook has a short walk of a couple of kms that features six waterfalls including Oaklands, Burgess & Horseshoe Falls. This track runs between Oaklands Rd & Winbourne Rd. Along the way is a rough overgrown track that leads to an amphitheatre area.   So around 20 waterfalls can found in several bushwalks within a few kms drive of each other in the Hazlebrook-Lawson area. Here youll find lovely patches of rainforest, impressive trees, wildflowers, colourful fungi, glow-worms, lizards, & yabbies. Enjoy!  "

The locals there find it comical when others marvel at the rainbows...its a common occurrence in Monteverde...with clear skies and rainbows galore...it set the pace for my descending trip from the cloud forest. La Fortuna's landscape is dominated by Volcn Arenal. I was told 80% of people who visit La Fortuna actually get to see the full view of the volcano as there are too many clouds. I was fotunate to be able to see the whole thing and wow what a sight. If you havent seen a volcano as I hadn't, it is awe inspiring, such a massive feature in the landscape. After sleeping a night, the next day I hiked around the Volcano and got to see a nice view of the valley and Lake.

The tone is set : even the Beijing Olympics ceremony cant compete with the mass games organized by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). The show is held several times a week and welcomes tourists from all over the World, including the US, in one of the most isolated and despised country on earth. The well-called  mass games  are designed to emphasize group dynamics rather than individual performances as the supreme emblem of communism. Prepared by hundred of thousands performers all along the year, after their classes for the youngest of them, they are entirely dedicated to the NKs leader Kim Jong Il and his deceased father Kim Il Sung, considered as the  Eternal president  and  sun of the 21st century      In the surroundings of Pyongyang's May Day giant Stadium, two girls are running to perform for the Arirang show. They are already dressed in their gymnastic outfits, as well as some 100,000 others who participate to the performance. They all come to honour their self-proclaimed  dear leader  Kim Jong Il, after a very hard and gruelling training, since their earliest age. Yet, it has been many years that Kim Jong Il has not shown up, formally for business reasons. But officials now admit the western medias assertions of illness. Anyways, Kim Jong Il or not, the mass games are held every year in Pyongyang, as a means for the regime to show to the entire world the countrys strength and good shape. To reach this sole purpose, not less than 100,000 people are involved in a choreographed show of simultaneous dancing and gymnastics. Many symbols are displayed by thousands of trained athlets, whether they are adults or even children. Hand over their heart, the young pupils sing in chorus ""We are the happiest children in the world"", one of the famous propaganda songs in North Korea. Many dancers make movements either with ribbons or colourful flowers named  kimjonglias  after the leader Kim Jong Il. All along the show, a live band plays a ceremonious music.   On the background, some 20,000 young koreans sit on the terraces, facing the spectators. They flip coloured cards at a high speed to form a fresco of animated and detailed images, changing from one to another. Each time they turn the page to create a new giant picture, they cry out. It creates a awe-inspiring atmosphere, as the shout is mixed with the noise of thousands of pages turned at the same moment. The figures are stunning : to compose these images, 2000 children  are needed to make only one soldier, 20,000 for a north korean flag. Hiding a much more grim reality, the panels represent Pyongyang enlightened by night, wheat fields ready for harvest, scientists at work, atoms as symbols of the nuclear bomb and others for the reunification of two Koreas. One of the North Koreas myths (history according to them) is recounted by the means of a huge image made by thousands of children. It represents the two pistols reportedly used by Kim Il Sung, when he founded the Anti-Japanese Peoples Guerrilla Army in 1932. When the pistols appear, the audience applauses loudly. Among them, many soldiers attend the show as the ultimate award after years of good and faithful service.The thousands and thousands of boys and girls involved create a giant mass movement in the stadium which leaves the public stunned. These talented performers are used to that kind of performance: in North Korea they have to dance, sing, jump and spin around as many times as there are celebrations, always in praise of their leaders. There are mainly two sorts of shows. The first one is the classical artistic show, named ""Arirang"" after the famous korean folk song (whose story sometimes changes, but most often  recounts the legend of a disappointed woman who hopes that her lover will return to her metaphor of the break-up with South Korea). The second one is a more political show, which was untitled in 2008 ""Prosper our country"" and intended to show the countrys greatest achievements and its struggle against the foreign oppressors.  The show continues in the same way for one hour. Thereafter, the thousands of people present vanish in the dark and silent streets of Pyongyang, which contrast with the flood of lights and music in the stadium. Within the space of a few hours, it gives us a a strange feeling, between the real and unreal, of another universe both terrifying and fantastic.    Dans toute la ville, les publicits dArirang ( Grande reprsentation gymnastique et artistique de masse ,  Bienvenue  Pyongyang  etc.) mettent le profane en garde Entre aot et octobre, a lieu lune des plus grandes et impressionnantes reprsentations au monde. Le ton est donn : pas mme la crmonie des Jeux de Pkin ne peut rivaliser avec les mass games organiss par la Rpublique Dmocratique Populaire de Core (RDPC). Le spectacle se tient plusieurs fois par semaine et accueille des touristes du monde entier, y compris des Etats-Unis, dans lun des pays les plus isols et mpriss sur terre. Les biens nomms mass games ( mouvements de masse) sont conus pour mettre en avant les dynamiques de groupe plutt que les performances individuelles comme emblme suprme du communisme. Prpars par des centaines de milliers dartistes tout au long de lanne, aprs les cours pour les plus jeunes dentre eux, les jeux sont entirement ddis au leader de la Core du Nord, Kim Jong Il, et feu son pre Kim Il Sung, considr comme l  Eternel prsident  et  soleil du 21me sicle   Aux environs du Stade gant May Day de Pyongyang, deux filles courent pour participer au spectacle de Arirang. Elles sont dj en costume de gymnastique, tout comme quelque 100 000 autres qui participent  la reprsentation. Tous viennent pour honorer leur autoproclam  cher leader  Kim Jong Il, aprs un trs difficile et prouvant entranement, depuis leur plus jeune ge. Pourtant, cela fait plusieurs annes que Kim Jong Il ne sest pas montr, formellement pour des raisons professionnelles. Mais des officiels admettent les assertions des mdias occidentaux sur sa maladie. Quoi quil en soit, Kim Jong Il ou pas, les jeux de masse ont lieu chaque anne  Pyongyang, comme moyen pour le rgime de montrer au monde entier la puissance et bonne sant du pays. Pour atteindre ce seul but, pas moins de 100 000 personnes sont engages dans une chorgraphie de danses et gymnastiques synchronises. De nombreux symboles sont affichs par des milliers dathltes entrans, quil sagisse dadultes ou mme denfants. Main sur le cur, les jeunes lves chantent en chur  Nous sommes les enfants les plus heureux du monde , lune des chansons de propagande les plus connues en Core du Nord. De nombreux danseurs font des mouvements avec des rubans ou avec des fleurs colores appeles  kimjonglias , du nom du leader Kim Jong Il. Tout le long du spectacle, un orchestre joue une musique solennelle.   larrire-plan, quelque 20 000 jeunes corens sont assis sur les gradins, faisant face aux spectateurs. Ils retournent des cartes colores  une grande vitesse pour former une fresque dimages animes et dtailles, changeant de lune  lautre. Chaque fois quils tournent la page pour crer une nouvelle illustration, ils crient. Cela cre une atmosphre impressionnante, le cri tant ml avec le bruit de milliers de pages tournes au mme moment. Les chiffres sont stupfiants : pour composer ces images, 2000 enfants sont ncessaires pour faire un seul soldat, 20 000 pour un drapeau de la Core du Nord. Cachant une ralit bien plus dure, les panneaux reprsentent Pyongyang claire la nuit, des champs de bl prt  tre rcolt, des scientifiques au travail, des atomes comme symboles de la bombe nuclaire et dautres pour la runification des deux Cores. Lun des mythes de Core du Nord (ou histoire selon eux) est relat au moyen dune image gigantesque faite par des milliers denfants. Elle reprsente les deux pistolets que Kim Il Sung aurait utiliss quand il a fond larme de gurilla populaire anti-japonaise en 1932. Lorsque les deux pistolets apparaissent, le public applaudit bruyamment. Parmi eux, de nombreux soldats assistent au spectacle comme rcompense ultime aprs des annes de bons et loyaux services. Les milliers et milliers de garons et de filles participant crent un mouvement de masse gant dans le stade, qui laisse le public bahi. Ces artistes talentueux sont coutumiers de ce type de reprsentation : en Core du Nord ils doivent danser, chanter, sauter et virevolter autant de fois quil y a de clbrations, toujours  la gloire de leurs chefs. Il existe principalement deux sortes de spectacles. Le premier est le spectacle classique artistique, appel  Arirang  daprs la clbre chanson folklorique corenne (dont lhistoire quelques fois change, mais qui raconte le plus souvent la lgende dune femme due qui espre que son amant lui reviendra mtaphore de la sparation avec la Core du Sud). Le second est un spectacle plus politique, qui tait intitul en 2008  Que prospre notre pays  et qui tentait de montrer les plus grandes ralisations du pays et sa lutte contre les oppresseurs trangers.   Le spectacle continue de cette faon pendant une heure. Ensuite, les milliers de personnes prsentes disparaissent dans les rues sombres et silencieuses de Pyongyang, ce qui contraste avec le dluge de lumires et de musique dans le stade. En lespace de quelques heures, cela nous donne un trange sentiment, entre le rel et lirrel, dun autre univers  la fois terrifiant et fantastique.    Eric Lafforgue www.ericlafforgue.com "

It is best known for containing the United States' largest and the world's second largest non-subglacial underground lake, The Lost Sea. In addition to the lake, the caverns contain an abundance of crystal clusters called anthodites, stalactites, stalagmites and a waterfall.  The lake was discovered in 1905 by a thirteen-year-old boy named Ben Sands. As the story goes Sands, who often played in the cave, happened upon a small opening and crawled through. The room was so large he was unable to see the ends of the room with his lantern, so he threw balls of mud in all directions and heard splashes. When he went back home and told people of his discovery they were hesitant to believe him. By the time Ben convinced his father to go back down with him to explore it further, the water level had risen, hiding the cave entrance from them. It was rediscovered by local explorers several years later. The visible surface of the lake measures 800 feet long and 220 feet wide (4.5 acres) at normal ""full"" capacity.  Cave divers have explored several rooms that are completely filled with water, without reaching the end of the cave. This exploration was conducted in the 1970s. For many years The Lost Sea was considered the world's largest underground lake and is still recognized as the world's second largest non-subglacial underground lake after Dragon's Breath Cave, Namibia.  Boat tours of the lake are still given and for many people are the highlight of the tour. In times of extreme drought (such as 2007-08) the lake recedes significantly and the management had to extend the walkway and the boat dock in order to be able to provide the boat tours. According to the management of the Lost Sea, the water level in the lake dropped 28 feet below its normal level at the height of the drought. At such times visitors see a much larger cavern above the lake surface.  There are also Rainbow Trout in the lake.  They aren't native to the Lost Sea, but were added to the lake decades ago in an attempt to see how big the lake was. (It didn't work.)  The tour guide has fish food which is thrown to the trout as part of the tour with the glass bottom boat.  These fish have also lost much of their color from being in a cave for so long.

During the latest heavy snow falls at the turn of the year, its huge cone, which had grown from a large hole in the ground (a pit crater) into a new mountain 200 m tall, had cooled enough so that snow remained lying on it.  Many of us - including quite a few of the volcanologists and geophysicists working on Etna - suspected that the phantastic series of immensely spectacular but also disruptive (especially to air traffic) eruptive episodes had come to a conclusion with the 15 November 2011 event.  The year 2012 began and immediately the Internet began to vibrate with haunting news announcing that a long-silent volcano in western Germany was about to wake up again (false news, actually). The Eruptions Blog followers had voted their favorite volcanoes of the year 2011, where Etna obtained a meagre position 4 (El Hierro, much less rewarding in terms of volcanic spectacle, was elected to position 2). Apparently, Etna felt the need to show off in a most majestic and glorious - and at the same time, awe-inspiring - manner. The relatively long interval of quiescence following the 15 November paroxysm ended after 51 days, on the evening of 4 January 2012, and culminated in a truly mindboggling way in the hours around daybreak on 5 January.  This photo was taken shortly after 06:15 h local time (= GMT+1) on 5 January 2012, during the buildup from strong Strombolian activity to continuous fountaining from a single vent within the crater, while lava was flowing down the southeast side of the cone (at left).   Look spectacular? You ain't seen nothing yet. Things were to become much, MUCH more spectacular soon."

After some heavy rain, hail and thunder the sky cleared way for more clouds to rise up from the valley below. Within minutes of this photo the glaciers were obscured by cloudy haze and our fantastic view was once again hidden.   The Bugaboos - August 12-18, 2012  Living in Squamish I am very lucky to be surrounded by excellent rock to train my technical climbing skills as well as many great peaks for scrambling. But, until last week I had never had the opportunity to combine the two skills I've been developing for years. That all changed when a friend invited me to be her partner on the yearly trip my friend group takes. Two months after the invitiation, a partner swap, and a week of careful packing and preparation I actually found myself driving east about to embark on what would be the greatest adventure of my life to date.   The moment I arrived at basecamp my lofty climbing aspiration were downgraded to starting with a 4th class route and going from there. I received tons of advice from friends that had been going for several years, but still nothing could have prepared me for the reality of being there. The ascent to Applebee basecamp, the scale of the spires, the difficulty of the glaciers, and the exposure did not translate well to maps and photos I found myself in awe and terror. Every single obstacle I encountered was more physically and mentally demanding that I could have expected.   Even though we were with a large group of friends, we were on our own when we headed out for the day and often learning as we went. As a result we learned many lessons the hard way, including when to put crampons on, when to switch into rock shoes, how hard preventing rockfall can be, and all the ways rappelling can go wrong.   It was both the single most terrifying and rewarding experience of my life. Never did I expect to learn so much in a week, or do so little actual climbing. Instead it was a wild ride of alpine obstacles, and a truly life changing experience shared with great friends old and new.   A brief summary of my adventure:  Aug 12 - Hike into Applebee base camp with 80+lbs pack full of climbing, camping, and glacier gear as well as 7 days of food, and clothes for everything from -10 to +30 degrees celcius rain and shine. Aug 13 - Eastpost spire, combination of Northeast and Northwest ridges. Aug 14 - Crescent Spire, W ridge. - Rained off first attempt, after self arresting and improv. anchor construction. Aug 15 - Crescent Spire, W ridge - Successful ascent followed by rappelling disaster involving ditching a rope that was later recovered Aug 16 - Pigeon Spire, W ridge - Got 30m up route then turned back to save terror management skills for descent back down the Bugaboo-Snowpatch col Aug 17 - Eastpost spire again and bathing in the tarn Aug 18 - Hike out and long drive home  Please feel free to contact me with any questions regarding my experience.  Photos from this trip were taken with a combination of my Nikon D7000, Olympus uT8000 & GoPro HD2"

They are probably one of the best-known mountain groups in the Alps. The three peaks, from east to west, are:  Cima Piccola/Kleine Zinne (""little peak"") Cima Grande/Groe Zinne (""big peak"") Cima Ovest/Westliche Zinne (""western peak"").  Until 1919 the peaks formed part of the border between Italy and Austria. Now they lie on the border between the Italian provinces of South Tyrol and Belluno and still are a part of the linguistic boundary between German-speaking and Italian-speaking majorities. The Cima Grande has an elevation of 2,999 metres (9,839 ft). It stands between the Cima Piccola, at 2,857 metres (9,373 ft), and the Cima Ovest, at 2,973 metres (9,754 ft).  Numerous routes lead from the surrounding communities to and around the peaks. The most common route is from Paternkofel/Monte Paterno to the alpine hut Auronzo at 2,333 m (7,654 ft), over Paternsattel (Patern Pass) to the alpine hut Dreizinnenhtte/Locatelli at 2,405 m (7,890 ft), and then to the peaks. There are a number of other routes as well.  Since the front line between Italy and Austria during World War I ran through these mountains, there are a number of fortifications, man-made caves, and commemorative plaques in the area."

Here is the outhouse on the Pigeon-Howser col with the Howser towers in the background. It was without a doubt the most scenic outhouse I have ever experienced.  The Bugaboos - August 12-18, 2012  Living in Squamish I am very lucky to be surrounded by excellent rock to train my technical climbing skills as well as many great peaks for scrambling. But, until last week I had never had the opportunity to combine the two skills I've been developing for years. That all changed when a friend invited me to be her partner on the yearly trip my friend group takes. Two months after the invitiation, a partner swap, and a week of careful packing and preparation I actually found myself driving east about to embark on what would be the greatest adventure of my life to date.  The moment I arrived at basecamp my lofty climbing aspiration were downgraded to starting with a 4th class route and going from there. I received tons of advice from friends that had been going for several years, but still nothing could have prepared me for the reality of being there. The ascent to Applebee basecamp, the scale of the spires, the difficulty of the glaciers, and the exposure did not translate well to maps and photos I found myself in awe and terror. Every single obstacle I encountered was more physically and mentally demanding that I could have expected.  Even though we were with a large group of friends, we were on our own when we headed out for the day and often learning as we went. As a result we learned many lessons the hard way, including when to put crampons on, when to switch into rock shoes, how hard preventing rockfall can be, and all the ways rappelling can go wrong.  It was both the single most terrifying and rewarding experience of my life. Never did I expect to learn so much in a week, or do so little actual climbing. Instead it was a wild ride of alpine obstacles, and a truly life changing experience shared with great friends old and new.  A brief summary of my adventure:  Aug 12 - Hike into Applebee base camp with 80+lbs pack full of climbing, camping, and glacier gear as well as 7 days of food, and clothes for everything from -10 to +30 degrees celcius rain and shine. Aug 13 - Eastpost spire, combination of Northeast and Northwest ridges. Aug 14 - Crescent Spire, W ridge. - Rained off first attempt, after self arresting and improv. anchor construction. Aug 15 - Crescent Spire, W ridge - Successful ascent followed by rappelling disaster involving ditching a rope that was later recovered Aug 16 - Pigeon Spire, W ridge - Got 30m up route then turned back to save terror management skills for descent back down the Bugaboo-Snowpatch col Aug 17 - Eastpost spire again and bathing in the tarn Aug 18 - Hike out and long drive home  Please feel free to contact me with any questions regarding my experience.  Photos from this trip were taken with a combination of my Nikon D7000, Olympus uT8000 & GoPro HD2"

The Australian Garden expresses a new direction in the design of Botanic Gardens particularly utilising Australian plants based on creative landscape experiences rather than bio-region or taxonomy. The project aims to offer an insight into the greater potential of using Australian flora in interesting, provocative and delightful ways in a more experiential and interpretive  setting.  A primary design theme of the Australian Garden at Cranbourne is the exploration and expression of the evolving relationship between Australians and their landscape and flora. The garden expresses this tension between Australians reverence and sense of awe for the natural landscape, and their innate impulse to change it, to make it into a humanly contrived form, beautiful yet their own work.  The Australian Garden was designed by Adelaide-based Taylor Cullity Lethlean together with Melbournes Paul Thompson.  "

I think that the explorers would have had a similar sense of regard and appreciation.  Though not untouched by human presence, these remote wild places are more protected from the ever-increasing rate of change and development, than many other undeveloped areas, closer to population centers.  Thus the landscape seems to be almost timeless.  Glaciers are receding, snowpack is smaller each year, climate change is adding increasing pressures, and trails are deeply rutted through fragile ecosystems.

The English herbaceous border in full flower is a breath taking and awe inspiring sight. When done on a grand scale its a true marvel of what skilled designers and gardeners can achieve. To construct an herbaceous border on the scale shown in these photos requires sufficient space, adequate manpower and resources and detailed horticultural knowledge too.  Although this type of border was at its most popular in the grand English gardens of the late 19th and early 20th centuries there are still some magnificent examples to be found in present day UK gardens.

Some of these renowned sights are the Arena, sixth largest in the world or Twin Gates, the Temple of Augustus, the well-preserved Roman Forum or the Communal Palace. However, not as much information is known about the impressive heritage of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy dating from the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, undoubtedly a real cultural and historic treasure. In fact, this refers to entire Pula, which from 1820 to 1916 was being architecturally shaped as a fortified town. Once the major naval port of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy Pula, together with its surroundings, has kept for over a century 26 magnificent forts or fortifications, as well as 8 artillery batteries, about 60 batteries, trenches, underground tunnels and many other points of interest. The outer ring of Pula's fortifications covers an area of 40,000 hectares and according to legend all forts were interconnected by a network of underground tunnels. Especially interesting is the story according to which Fort Marie Louise at Muzil was connected with the fort on the Brijuni islands by an underwater tunnel.  Pula's fortifications were designed to defend the city from possible attacks from the sea and were built to resist every possible attack - for this reason they were mostly circular or ring-like so that shells could rebound off the walls. They were all built at excellent locations, mostly lookouts that even today offer a magnificent view.  The fortifications of Pula and its surroundings were never used for a specific attack and defense of the city, although according to some sources, in 1915 Pula's garrison consisted of as many as 1,410 officers and over 51 thousand soldiers. Owing to the fact that the forts were never attacked from the sea, today Pula has a completely preserved significant fortification complex. "

These tiny Pikas, also known as Rock Rabbits, hardly ever remain still and they are extremely fast!  Imagine a mountain hillside covered in sharp, jagged rocks of all sizes and then try to picture how difficult it is to find in the viewfinder the single rock on which one of these Pikas might happen to sit for a second or two, lol!  The rock in my photo was a particularly nice one, standing out because it was bigger than the rocks immediately around it and it was covered in various Lichens.  This little Pika made a quick, two-second stop on it several times, surveying the grasses and plants around it before dashing to gather a huge mouthful of ""fresh greens"" and then bounding up the rocky mountain slope to add its collection to a little cave among the rocks.  They rely on existing spaces between the rocks for their homes - they don't dig a burrow, though they can dig to make their home bigger.  Because the Pikas are a similar colour to the surrounding rocks, it is difficult to see them - unless you happen to catch sight of some movement or you see a bunch of greenery moving at top speed over the rocks.  As time passed, I managed to take quite a lot of photos, though many needed to be deleted.  Hope you don't get tired of seeing these little guys, but they are just so very cute.  They are about 15 to 23 centimetres (5.9 to 9.1 in) in body length, so really are pretty small.  And, no, I didn't put one in my pocket to bring home with me!  ""The American Pika is a generalist herbivore. It eats a large variety of green plants, including different kinds of grasses, sedges, thistles and fireweed. Although pikas can meet their water demands from the vegetation they eat, they do drink water if it is available in their environment. Pikas have two different ways of foraging: they directly consume food (feeding) or they cache food in haypiles to use for a food source in the winter (haying). The pika feeds throughout the year while haying is limited to the summer months. Since they do not hibernate, pikas have greater energy demands than other montane mammals. In addition, they also make 13 trips per hour to collect vegetation when haying, up to a little over 100 trips per day.""  From Wikipedia.  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_pika  I found this excellent and amusing YouTube video, 3:30 minutes long,  It is The American Pika in the BBC's Life of Mammals series.  youtu.be/Sifk9uphr2Q  The weather forecast was not good for that day, but we were so lucky that, apart from a few raindrops, the rain stayed away.  The sun actually came out at two locations we stopped at for a short while.  Our 18-hour day (from 6;00 a.m. till midnight!) started off with the thrill of seeing these Pikas and ended with a brief sighting of a black Wolf (could it be Skoki?) crossing the road ahead of us in the dark.  It disappeared into the blackness, but shortly afterwards, we heard three (possibly four) separate Wolves howling way off in the distance.  We just stood there, in total awe, listening to this amazing sound.  The only wild Wolf I had ever seen before was when I was in Yellowstone National Park two years ago.  Friends and I saw two Wolves feeding on a Bison carcass across a huge valley - so they were just distant specks, that became slightly larger specks when my camera was in full zoom, ha.  In between these two highlights, we saw several Deer, a small group of Mountain Sheep on the road, a tiny Chipmunk, a few Cedar Waxwings, Columbian Ground Squirrels, a beautiful Red-tailed Hawk that sat on a branch out in the open for a long time, and two tiny Bats that flew very close over our heads when it was getting dark.  We also saw an adult Grouse (Spruce Grouse?) with two young ones.  Then, of course, there is the scenery!  Blue sky to go with the splendour of the mountains would have been wonderful, but we had been having cold and gloomy weather for a while before this day out.  Highway 40 and the Smith-Dorrien/Spray Lakes Trail both run through such spectacular scenery, so it was a real treat for me, especially as I won't drive to those areas myself.  "

The main reason behind choosing cologne is that my awesome senior brother/friend Aman Bhai studies is Bonn University and Cologne is the closest city from there to arrive in Germany. Even unlike the other countries I visited, for Germany, I did not go through any tour guide, any webpage regarding it. I had all the faith on him. Thank you Aman bhai for taking all the hassle and for giving me the most pleasant experiences in the whole Euro Trip.  German, as a nation, to my opinion, is the most civilized and humane nation of the world. They are always smiling you back or giving you gentle nod irrespective of the fact that your color is way browner than them ! I was so in awe with the whole experience of Germany that in only 3 days, it made me rethink of going there again and again !  This shot was taken at the Cologne Cathedral (Klner Dom). It is Germany's one of the most visited landmarks, attracting an average of 20,000 people a day. During the WW2, whereas the whole city was flattened by bombing, this cathedral did not collapse and stood still ! I remember entering in to cathedral and taking snaps here and there. Suddenly one priest stopped me by holding my hand. I got a little intimidated that may be he did not like me photographing or may be the whole idea of a brown colored foreigner roaming around the cathedral made him irritated. To my surprise, he gave me a smile and put down my monkey cap from my head and said in clear English - 'You should not wear this in a church my son' ! I was really shy for my unmindful behavior and I made sure I dont do the same mistake again in the upcoming churches visits through out the Euro Tour !  My this photo is dedicated to awesome Aman Bhai !"

The vestry on the north side of the chancel, for example, which was once a shrine chapel, retains its image niche on its eastern face. And there are more image niches, these with elaborate foliage pedestals, in the buttresses of the tower; everything is topped off by a lead and timber fleche which was apparently the model for the one at St Peter Mancroft in Norwich, a church which has several features in common with this one.  The tower is a delight, the buttressing and pinnacles exactly in proportion to make it appear to rise like a fairy castle from the ground. The south porch, by contrast, is, despite its flushwork, rather austere, a result of its rebuilding early in the 19th century before the ecclesiological movement took hold. All in all, this is as good as 15th century rebuilding gets, the money coming thanks to Anne Harling having no less than three husbands who all wanted to spend as little time in purgatory as possible.  You step down into a wide space which, on a dull day, can be rather gloomy. Although inevitably heavily restored by the Victorians, St Peter and St Paul does not have that depressingly anonymous urban feel you so often find in churches of this size. This is partly because the beautiful parclose screen in the south aisle partitions off so much space, creating a sense of rooms within rooms, altering the way your eyes are inevitably drawn to the east. The rood screen must have been vast here; its dado survives at the west end, a deeply traceried affair with its features presented in carving rather than painting.  When the rood screen was in its proper place, to move from the nave into the chancel must have been like stepping from darkness into light. This is because of the feature that makes East Harling famous, the vast east window with its 15th century glass. After St Peter Mancroft it is the best collection in Norfolk. Unusually, the provenance of the glass is fairly well-documented: we can be fairly certain that it came from this church originally. Still present after the Reformation, it was removed by the Harling family to the Hall in the early 17th century. They may have been Laudians wanting to preserve it from the intentions of the puritans, or merely thought it would look nice in their dining hall; whatever, we know that shortly before Francis Blomefield visited here in the 1730s it was returned to the church and set in its present configuration.  In 1939, when war threatened, it was removed again, being reset just before Cautley visited in the early 1950s. There are parts of at least three sequences here, two of which were almost certainly in the east window originally, and one which almost certainly wasn't.  Essentially, the window contains two rosary sequences; the Joyful Mysteries of the Blessed Virgin, which include the Annunciation, the Nativity and the Assumption, and the Sorrowful Mysteries of the Blessed Virgin, which include the Crucifixion and the Deposition. However, this is open to interpretation, as we shall see. There is also the figure of St Mary Magdalene, which may once have been associated with a nave altar, and would have been located in a window there.  The five lights contain four rows of panels, making twenty altogether.  Top row: I. Annunciation: Mary at her prayer desk. Gabriel, crowned and haloed, with a sceptre of lilies, kneels in supplication. II. Visitation: Elizabeth, hooded to show her age, places her hand on Mary's pregnant belly. III. Nativity: Two midwives look on. The infant in the manger is rayed; a horned cow gazes in awe. IV. Adoration of the Shepherds: One holds a lamb, one plays pipes. A third appears to offer a fleece. V. Adoration of the Magi: Two of the wise men gauge each others' reactions as the third offers his gift.  Second row: VI: collection of fragments. VII: Presentation in the Temple: Joseph carries the doves, Mary offers the child to Simeon. Anna is not shown. VIII: The Finding in the Temple: Head covered, Mary bursts in among the men to find her son teaching. IX: The Wedding at Canaa: Christ, seated at the top table, blesses a chicken and a ham. Mary directs the servant. X: collection of fragments.  Third row: XI: Mary of Magdala: Mary holds her long hair ready to anoint Christ's feet. Probably not from this window originally. XII: The Betrayal at Gethsemane: Judas kisses Christ; Peter cuts off the ear of the high priest's servant. XIII: Crucifixion: Mary swoons in John's arms. XIV: Deposition from the cross: The pieta. Tears spring from Mary's eyes. XV: Assumption of the Blessed Virgin: Mary is assumed bodily into heaven.  Bottom row: XVI: Donor: Probably Robert Wingfield, second husband of Anne Harling. XVII: Resurrection: Christ steps fully clothed from the tomb. Unusually, the soldiers are awake. XVIII: Ascension of Christ: Mary, surrounded by disciples, watches as her son ascends to heaven. XIX: Descent of the Holy Spirit: Mary, surrounded by disciples, receives the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. XX: Donor: Probably William Chamberlain, first husband of Anne Harling.  Nowadays, we tend to think of the rosary as consisting of three sequences of five mysteries each, but in the late middle ages things were much more flexible, and rosary sequences often consisted of seven mysteries. The Glorious Mysteries sequence, of which the Assumption is now a part, is a later development, and the two adorations shown here are subsumed into a single mystery. There are a couple of images here that don't quite fit; the Wedding at Canaa is obviously a Marian text, and yet is not traditionally a rosary subject. Similarly the Betrayal, the only one of the images not to feature Mary. I wonder if what we have here are parts of two separate sequences, a Marian sequence of mysteries (I-V, VII-IX, XV), and a Passion sequence (XII-XIV, XVII-XIX). They are both clearly the work of the same workshop, and Mary is always shown with the same face and dress, but this would not preclude them from being two sequences.  Why were they here at all? We need to get away from thinking of such things as a 'poor man's bible', the need for which was superseded at the Reformation. These were devotional objects, designed to be used as meditations while praying and saying the rosary. They were created in the 15th century, a time when the mind of the Church was fiercely concentrated on asserting orthodox Catholic doctrine in the face of local superstitions and abuses. As such, they were anathema to the reformers, and were later elsewhere destroyed for being superstitious, not for being superfluous. An 18th century antiquarian mind, ignorant of the nature of Catholic devotion, might easily mix the two sequences into historical order, and possibly misunderstand the Assumption (obviously, as Mary reappears two images on at the Ascension, it is out of order). I wonder what they thought it was?  A couple of other things about the east window that you shouldn't miss. Firstly, everywhere you look there are tiny baskets - Mortlock calls them 'frails', and tells us that they were simple rush baskets used by workmen to carry tools. Also, though not in such profusion, there are bodices. These symbols are repeated elsewhere in the church in stone on tombs, and as such must be symbols of the Harling family.  Another symbol is high up on the north side, a red squirrel. Curiously, this also appears in the painting A Lady with a Squirrel and a Starling by Hans Holbein, now thought to be a portrait of Anne Lovell - the squirrel is a symbol of the Lovell family, who took over the local manor here from the Harlings in the 16th century, and the starling represents Ea- well, you guess.  In July 2006, Chris Harrison and I came across  some more glass from East Harling  in the Norfolk County Archaeologist Service archive at Gressenhall. It was probably removed from the church for safety in 1939, and then not replaced, possibly ending up at the museum of church art in Norwich at St Peter Hungate, disappearing into storage when that closed in 1993. It depicts a Bishop and Christ seated in Majesty, and the lozenges in between carry the telltale frails and bodices familiar from other glass within the church.  Within the screen is a large chapel, containing two major tombs. One is in alabaster, an early 17th century memorial to Sir Thomas and Lady Alice Lovell (remember the squirrel?) who died in 1604. The piece is good - too good, its 1950s restoration gives it a Festival of Britain air. Their symbols lie at their feet - his a magnificent peacock, hers a gruesome Saracen scalp held aloft.  The other appears to be a composite. It lies to the east, and the two effigies are clearly not from this tomb; they simply don't fit. They are supposed to be Robert Harling, died Paris in 1435, and his wife Dame Joan. Neither are buried here - she is at Rushford near Thetford, he is in some corner of a foreign field that is forever French schoolchildren on picnics excitedly tugging old thighbones from the soil - but in any case it is the trimmings of the tomb rather than the effigies that are most of interest, including a pelican in her piety and one that is almost a lily crucifix.  On the north side of the chancel is a fine tomb with brass inlays - the brasses now gone. Not as magnificent as either of the two previously mentioned, it is actually the most significant, as this is where you'll find Anne Harling, wife of the serial rebuilders of this church. Look out for those flails again.  What more? 17th century Lovells (remember the squirrel) have in-yer-face memorials either side of the sanctuary - that to the north curiously with no inscription. There are hatchments, remains of a wallpainting that are too indistinct to interpret (but may be seven works of mercy), a good set of royal arms, medieval heads, curious 19th century bench ends of a lion and a wild man, heraldic misericords, a Dec font - well, come and see for yourself. You know you want to."

It lies at the mouth of the Umzimvubu River, a river flowing through an impressive gorge known as the ""Gates of St John"" into an estuary located on the Indian Ocean. On both sides of the river ravine are high sandstone mountain peaks: Mount Thesiger (342 metres above sea level) and Mount Sullivan (304 meter), named after two British Military officers.   It is the main settlement in the Port St. Johns Local Municipality which forms part of the O.R. Tambo District Municipality in Pondoland of the former Transkei. According to the 2011 census it had a population of 6,441, of whom 90% where Xhosa-speaking.   The climate is humid subtropical.   In the area near the town, some of the most significant Travertine deposits in South Africa are found. About 10 km west of Port St. Johns, sandstone is excavated for architectural use"" ~ Wiki   Both photos Canon South Africa 6D, 17-40mm @ ISO 100   Umzimvubu - 1/40 sec, F11 & Port St John's e-painting 2.5 sec, F9   I struggled with the processing of both photos and will return for round 2 in a few days weeks or months.

This extraordinary county and state regional park protects nearly 1,000 acres of habitat that hosts more than 700 species of plants and animals. The reserve is located in north San Diego, between Solana Beach and Encinitas, extending inland to Rancho Santa Fe. You can hike along seven miles of trails, and come along for naturalist-guided Weekend Walks. Scan the landscape for awe-inspiring sightings of rare and migratory birds.

Perhaps when you were very young, the reflected light of a mirror became a mischievous elf; maybe the sound of a triangle being struck or the breeze in the trees inspired you to hope you might just encounter these delicate, magical beings.  Vivid Sydney lures these dwellers of fantastical dimensions to our harbourside, with When the Fairies Come Out to Play.  The artwork comprises 200 illuminated, kinetic ornaments which flit and flutter playfully, shimmering in the dark and allowing themselves to be seen by the mere mortals who wander through the park. These tiny sprites recreate the sense of awe you once felt when you believed in the possibility of enchanted forests, bewitched flowers and spirits that lived at the bottom of your garden.  The fairies are brought to life by energy-efficient, pre-programmed LED chips, which continuously twinkle through the colour spectrum.  Wander through the pathways between these whirling creatures and let yourself be entranced.  Kathryn Bevz and Martin Bevz have worked as a team since early 2011, translating design concepts into fully functional, interactive lighting installations. They have exhibited at Vivid Sydney for the last three years, with Immersion in 2011, which was also exhibited at Light Marina Bay 2012, Sea Grass and LightHop in 2012 and Sky Grass in 2013.  Martin has worked for bespoke production company 32 Hundred Lighting since 2004, focusing on short-turn-around events, effective creative concepts and energy-efficient solutions.  Kathryn has been teaching primary school students since completing her Bachelor of Arts, Diploma of Education in 2012. As an industry outsider she continually draws upon her experiences in education to create installations which focus on simplicity and accessibility for all."

Unfortunately, this is my best shot of the bird because when it wasn't flying from tree to tree, it was behind some leafy brush.

Huge beasts stalked majestically through the streets of Norwich. Prehistoric birds flying overhead. A mythical world came alive.  This years Festival opened in awesome style with Invasion, a highly mobile  and highly exciting  street spectacle. Invasion created an all-enveloping experience, as prehistoric animals moved through the audience and animal voices sounded from every direction. The beasts, came from all sides, leaving people confused: should they follow or flee? But chaos was avoided by a magical song that attracts the animals and restored calm, leaving the crowds to go with the flow of the unique and enthralling event.  Large animals moved between the public. A mythical world came alive; animal sounds were heard everywhere. A dark figure appeared as a prehistoric bird flew overhead. The area was completely filled as all the creatures spread out, causing confusion among the people; should they run or follow? The chaos ended by a magical song that attracted the animals and calmed them!  Invasion - An unforgettable moving street spectacle that moves the crowd like a sea. People see impressive figures and forget the actors inside the costumes. All get carried away: this is a unique experience! Performed by Close-Act Theatre a professional company of stilt walkers, dancers, musicians, fire throwers and acrobats, training and rehearsing together on a regular basis. Close-Act also has a studio of costume designers, visual artists, graphic and industrial designers. Work-students from different colleges come to our studio often for an internship. Last but not least Close-Act has an office with fantastic people who maintain relations with both clients and performers. They are also involved in developing special concepts and scenarios and most of them combine the office work with performing or working in the studio. The different disciplines and backgrounds of all these people make for interesting interaction and a surprising mix when we are creating new performances. Leading forces and inspirators of Close-Act are artistic directors Hesther Melief and Tonny Aerts. From their brains the concepts for the performances originate and they give direction to all people until the performance reaches its final form. Close-Act was founded in 1991 and settled in a monumental farm in Tilburg in 2003. The actors and co-workers come from all over the Netherlands and Belgium. From the start Close-Act has been performing abroad. Mostly in Europe at first, but since the success of performances such as Malaya and the mobile acts Saurus and White Wings, Close-Act travels across the world. Close-Act is always on the move. The company aims on launching a new performance every two years. New mobile acts are created each year. Existing acts are constantly improved with new costumes, acting, dance and technical innovations. With Malaya Close-Act found a form that best suits their vision on Street Theatre. Instead of using a stage or a fenced-off playsite, the actors and mobile objects move between and above the crowd. This ultimate form of interactive street theatre has great impact on the audience. The big mobile objects and beautifully designed costumes are best suited for a large audience. Close-Act therefore performs mainly at street theatre festivals and large scaled events."

Light from the many cabins on the far shore reflected in the mirror perfect water and the pines backlit by moonlit smoke from many fireplaces and fog that had clung to the hills during sunset.

Nonetheless, the hike in new territory seeing and being in a new space is always good for the mind. After my journey to Monteverde, I went to the small town of La Fortuna. On my departing journey from Monteverde, there had to be at least 15 rainbows or ""arcoiris"" ...incredible. The locals there find it comical when others marvel at the rainbows...its a common occurrence in Monteverde...with clear skies and rainbows galore...it set the pace for my descending trip from the cloud forest. La Fortuna's landscape is dominated by Volcn Arenal. I was told 80% of people who visit La Fortuna actually get to see the full view of the volcano as there are too many clouds. I was fotunate to be able to see the whole thing and wow what a sight. If you havent seen a volcano as I hadn't, it is awe inspiring, such a massive feature in the landscape. After sleeping a night, the next day I hiked around the Volcano and got to see a nice view of the valley and Lake.

The Indus runs through entire Ladakh all along by your side serving as a constant companion and you feel a sense of respect for this stream of water that is the lifeline of the people of Ladakh, especially since Ladakh experiences a rainfall of only 2 to 3 inches throughout the year. A land of endless beauty in the form of dry land with monasteris dotting its landscape and lakes so pure that you can only stand agape in awe, is made more exotic by the Indus, on the banks of which one can spend endless evenings just looking into the vastness of Ladakh and reasonably concluding that it is this virgin nature of the land mostly untouched since decades that has kept the people in this gifted land insulated from the world that we claim to be modern.  Soon my first book on 111 MIRACULOUS WONDERS OF WORLD YOU MUST SEE WHEN U ALIVE will be out with ""111 WOW"" i Phone application by the end of this year. Updating my official website sundeepkullu.com    With Indus constantly flowing by our side, you do not realise that you had reached Nimu. It was only when the driver pointed out that the grandiosity of the sight that unfolded right before our eyes came to the fore. Right in front of us were the Indus and Zanskar Rivers getting lost into each other as if they had flown all along just for that. From this point on, beyond this Confluence of the two, the stream of water is regarded as the Indus River and the Zanskar does not exist beyond this point.     What amazes you most about this Confluence is the difference in colours of the two rivers. The Zanskar no more remains its muddy self beyond this point and loses its parent nature in the process of becoming a part of the Indus making it a sight worth jotting down in your memory book.     The Indus is bright blue, the Zanskar is muddy. The mighty river Indus originates in Tibet, enters Ladakh region of India, flows through Kashmir & enters Pakistan, where it ends it's journey by emptying into the Arabian sea near Karachi. It has many tributeries, some of which are big rivers themselves. One of the world's oldest civilization, the Indus Valley Civilization, grew up in its valley about 35000 years back.     The Suru and Zangskar valleys form a great trough at the foot of the northern, heavily glaciated flank of the Himalayas, while opposite rise the mountains of the Zanskar range. The Suru River forms the western and northern boundary of the Zanskar range. The Suru, after receiving the combined waters of the Dras and Shingo Rivers a short distance north of Kargil, joins the Indus at Marol in Baltistan, which is now on the Pakistan side of the Line of Control.     The Zanskar River is a north-flowing tributary of the Indus. In its upper reaches, the Zanskar has two main branches. First of these, the Doda, has its source near the Pensi-la (4,400 m) (14,450 ft) mountain-pass and flows south-eastwards along the main Zanskar valley leading towards Padum, the capital of Zanskar. The second branch is formed by two main tributaries known as Kargyag river, with its source near the Shingo La (5,091 m) (16,703 ft), and Tsarap river, with its source near the Baralacha-La. These two rivers unite below the village of Purne to form the Lungnak river (also known as the Lingti or Tsarap). The Lungnak river then flows north-westwards along a narrow gorge towards Zanskar's central valley (known locally as gzhung khor), where it unites with the Doda river to form the main Zanskar river. This river then takes a north-eastern course through the dramatic Zanskar Gorge until it joins the Indus near Nimmu in Ladakh.

Randy Van Winkle and I started our adventure from the trailhead at Yankee Boy Basin and made the steep hike in the dark to reach the pass before the sun rose. The conditions looked bleak, very thick clouds but Randy's PMA paid off with dividends. The sun peaked through the clouds lighting up the clouds, the peaks and totally blew our minds when a double rainbow appeared. I was so excited I was shaking and kept telling myself 'don't f$%k this up!' somehow I pulled off this pano at the peak of the action. It will be hard for me to ever top this experience.

Although the site was known in Aztec times as the 'Birthplace of the Gods' it is actually significantly older, with most of the major structures built between 100-250AD and the city, one of the largest ever ancient settlements in the Americas, was believed to have been still inhabited up to the 8th century.  Today the vast scale of the complex, particularly the so called Avenue of the Dead, nearly 3km long and flanked by ancient ruins and terraces, continues to awe visitors. At the north end of the Avenue sits the Pyramid of the Moon, whilst it's much larger counterpart, the Pyramid of the Sun, sits halfway up it's eastern side. At the southern end sits the Ciudadela complex which centres on the smaller pyramid of Quetzelcoatl, earlier and more ruined than the larger pyramids but retaining it's stunning original sculptural decoration on part of it's western face, featuring the iconic feathered serpent heads.

Access to the Kilchurn Castle is sometimes restricted by higher-than-usual levels of water in the Loch, at which times the site effectively becomes a temporary island. The day we went to visit the loch was low enough for us to make our way to the castle. Kilchurn Castle was built in about 1450 by Sir Colin Campbell, first Lord of Glenorchy, as a five storey tower house with a courtyard defended by an outer wall. By about 1500 an additional range and a hall had been added to the south side of the castle. Further buildings went up during the 16th and 17th centuries. Kilchurn Castle is a ruined 15th and 17th century structure on a rocky peninsula at the northeastern end of Loch Awe. . Argyll and Bute, Scotland"

There's parking garages and luggage pickup to deal with, and God help us if we park in the dreaded 'white zone'...

Huge beasts stalked majestically through the streets of Norwich. Prehistoric birds flying overhead. A mythical world came alive.  This years Festival opened in awesome style with Invasion, a highly mobile  and highly exciting  street spectacle. Invasion created an all-enveloping experience, as prehistoric animals moved through the audience and animal voices sounded from every direction. The beasts, came from all sides, leaving people confused: should they follow or flee? But chaos was avoided by a magical song that attracts the animals and restored calm, leaving the crowds to go with the flow of the unique and enthralling event.  Large animals moved between the public. A mythical world came alive; animal sounds were heard everywhere. A dark figure appeared as a prehistoric bird flew overhead. The area was completely filled as all the creatures spread out, causing confusion among the people; should they run or follow? The chaos ended by a magical song that attracted the animals and calmed them!  Invasion - An unforgettable moving street spectacle that moves the crowd like a sea. People see impressive figures and forget the actors inside the costumes. All get carried away: this is a unique experience! Performed by Close-Act Theatre a professional company of stilt walkers, dancers, musicians, fire throwers and acrobats, training and rehearsing together on a regular basis. Close-Act also has a studio of costume designers, visual artists, graphic and industrial designers. Work-students from different colleges come to our studio often for an internship. Last but not least Close-Act has an office with fantastic people who maintain relations with both clients and performers. They are also involved in developing special concepts and scenarios and most of them combine the office work with performing or working in the studio. The different disciplines and backgrounds of all these people make for interesting interaction and a surprising mix when we are creating new performances. Leading forces and inspirators of Close-Act are artistic directors Hesther Melief and Tonny Aerts. From their brains the concepts for the performances originate and they give direction to all people until the performance reaches its final form. Close-Act was founded in 1991 and settled in a monumental farm in Tilburg in 2003. The actors and co-workers come from all over the Netherlands and Belgium. From the start Close-Act has been performing abroad. Mostly in Europe at first, but since the success of performances such as Malaya and the mobile acts Saurus and White Wings, Close-Act travels across the world. Close-Act is always on the move. The company aims on launching a new performance every two years. New mobile acts are created each year. Existing acts are constantly improved with new costumes, acting, dance and technical innovations. With Malaya Close-Act found a form that best suits their vision on Street Theatre. Instead of using a stage or a fenced-off playsite, the actors and mobile objects move between and above the crowd. This ultimate form of interactive street theatre has great impact on the audience. The big mobile objects and beautifully designed costumes are best suited for a large audience. Close-Act therefore performs mainly at street theatre festivals and large scaled events."

The F-15E was designed in the 1980s for long-range, high speed interdiction without relying on escort or electronic warfare aircraft. United States Air Force (USAF) F-15E Strike Eagles can be distinguished from other U.S. Eagle variants by darker camouflage and conformal fuel tanks mounted along the engine intakes.  The Strike Eagle has been deployed in Operation Desert Storm, Operation Allied Force, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Odyssey Dawn carrying out deep strikes against high-value targets, combat air patrols, and providing close air support for coalition troops. It has also seen action in later conflicts and has been exported to several countries.  The building in the background is the American Air Museum.  From the late 1970s the Imperial War Museum Duxford acquired a number of important American aircraft; a B-17G Flying Fortress in 1978, a B-29 Superfortress in 1980, and a B-52 Stratofortress in 1983. With Duxford's association with the US Army Air Forces, in the mid-1980s plans developed for a commemoration of the role of American air power in the Second World War. A group of American supporters was formed, and the architect Sir Norman Foster was commissioned to design a new building. Fundraising for the project began in 1987, support and funds being sought in the United States; the Founding Member was General Jimmy Doolittle in 1989. Fundraising events were held across the US in Houston (1989), Washington, D.C., (1991) and Los Angeles (1992). The project was widely supported in the United States by some 50,000 individual subscribers. A further $1million of funding was secured from Saudi Arabia, and 6.5million from the Heritage Lottery Fund. On 8 September 1995 the groundbreaking for the new building was performed by wartime 78th Fighter Group veteran, Major James E Stokes.  The American Air Museum was designed by Sir Norman Foster and Chris Wise at Arup. The museum's specification called for a landmark building that would provide a neutral backdrop for the aircraft collection and provide appropriate climatic controls while being cost efficient to operate. The building is shaped as a section of a torus, formed from a curved concrete roof 90 m (300 ft) wide, 18.5 m (61 ft) high and 100 m (330 ft) deep. The dimensions of the building were dictated by the need to accommodate the museum's B-52 Stratofortress bomber with its 61 m (200 ft) wingspan and a tail 16 m (52 ft) high. The roof (with the sun glinting off it) was constructed as a double-layered concrete shell, built in 924 precast reinforced concrete sections. Inverted T-shaped sections provided the inner layer with further flat panels forming the outer layer.  The roof weighs 6000 tonnes and is able to support suspended aircraft weighing up to 10 tonnes. The glass wall on the left, is demountable to permit aircraft to be rearranged, allows in daylight, reduces lighting costs and enables the aircraft to be seen from the outside. It also allows visitors inside the museum to watch aircraft on the airfield landing or taking off. From a visitor's perspective, the pedestrian entrance, reached by the road on the right, leads to a mezzanine floor level with the cockpit of the museum's B-52, while the lack of supporting columns allows aircraft to hang from the ceiling. Heavier aircraft stand on the floor of the building, which covers 6,500 m2 (70,000 sq ft). Construction began with the building of abutments in October 1995 and the roof was completed in September 1996. The building won the 1998 Stirling Prize for Foster and Partners and was described by the judges as ""a great big, clear span hangar of a building...dramatic, awe-inspiring, an object of beauty...simple yet replete with imagery.""  The  Imperial War Museum Duxford (commonly referred to simply as ""Duxford"") is a branch of the Imperial War Museum near the village of Duxford in Cambridgeshire, England. Britain's largest aviation museum, Duxford houses the museum's large exhibits, including nearly 200 aircraft, military vehicles, artillery and minor naval vessels in seven main exhibitions buildings. The site also provides storage space for the museum's other collections of material such as film, photographs, documents, books and artefacts. The site accommodates a number of British Army regimental museums, including those of the Parachute Regiment (named Airborne Assault) and the Royal Anglian Regiment.  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_F-15E_Strike_Eagle"

Cathedrals are such moving experiences.  You don't even have to be all that religious to be transported by them.  I know, because I don't consider myself to be a terribly religious fellow (at least not in that fashion), yet one of the most amazing places I have ever stood is in the center of St. Peter's Basilica.  There is so much to be awed by on so many levels.    Granted, sometimes it strikes me as a bit incredible that religion can simultaneously propel us to build something as grand and majestic (with more than a touch of hubris as well for spice) as some of the chapels/cathedrals/mosques/etc of the world while at the same time serving as a means or motivation for war, oppression, murder, etc.  Not to mention the history of how some of these cathedrals are built and paid for...  But that is that, whatever it may be.   Oddly enough, despite that complicated mix of history that religion is always embroiled in, or maybe because of it, cathedrals have such power to them.  I have walked through St. Peter's and St. Paul's and Notre Dame and I can tell you it is near impossible to not be affected by the presence such buildings host, even if I cannot quite tell you why that is.  Age.  Mythos.  History.  Hopes and prayers and optimism.  It is heady stuff and so I often seek them out when I am visiting far-away cities (because the ones in the U.S. are just not the same), even if I don't often make photos in them... for a variety of reasons.  Some things it is ok to not photograph, but to just experience.  When I do photograph cathedrals and such, it tends to be from outside and at a distance.    And so it was with St. Paul's (though I am bummed I missed being able to climb to the top by about 15 minutes).  In a couple of months I'll be able to experience Chartres and Avignon and I am really looking forward to seeing both of those.  The Hagia Sophia is also on that list too, but that will have to wait a couple more years I think.  But now I ramble, not that I wasn't to begin with."

Some of these renowned sights are the Arena, sixth largest in the world or Twin Gates, the Temple of Augustus, the well-preserved Roman Forum or the Communal Palace. However, not as much information is known about the impressive heritage of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy dating from the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, undoubtedly a real cultural and historic treasure. In fact, this refers to entire Pula, which from 1820 to 1916 was being architecturally shaped as a fortified town. Once the major naval port of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy Pula, together with its surroundings, has kept for over a century 26 magnificent forts or fortifications, as well as 8 artillery batteries, about 60 batteries, trenches, underground tunnels and many other points of interest. The outer ring of Pula's fortifications covers an area of 40,000 hectares and according to legend all forts were interconnected by a network of underground tunnels. Especially interesting is the story according to which Fort Marie Louise at Muzil was connected with the fort on the Brijuni islands by an underwater tunnel.  Pula's fortifications were designed to defend the city from possible attacks from the sea and were built to resist every possible attack - for this reason they were mostly circular or ring-like so that shells could rebound off the walls. They were all built at excellent locations, mostly lookouts that even today offer a magnificent view.  The fortifications of Pula and its surroundings were never used for a specific attack and defense of the city, although according to some sources, in 1915 Pula's garrison consisted of as many as 1,410 officers and over 51 thousand soldiers. Owing to the fact that the forts were never attacked from the sea, today Pula has a completely preserved significant fortification complex. "

I am always in awe of her work. Check some of her stuff out at katrinabartley.com  This is one of the panorama's I managed. The ship in the background is an old chase ship used when whaling was being carried out in the area. Long gone have the whaling days of Albany, what is left provides great photographic opportunities . I hope you enjoy this shot.
