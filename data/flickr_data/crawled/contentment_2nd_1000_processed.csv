I decided on Thursday that I would do it then.  I had stopped at the grocery store on my way home from work and realized that I was losing light really fast. I got home, changed quickly and headed back out.   I parked in a spot just off the road and walked through high weeds and didn't know what I might find there. Nothing much was inside and there was a lot of graffiti on the inside walls. I set up my tripod in front of this side that faced the setting sun.   I had no ideas before I got here as far as what to shoot. Keeping in mind that I wanted to reflect a mood, I thought this shot would work best closer up rather than trying to capture the entire barn, because it's huge (I'll have to come back again). Besides, I liked this door frame and the peeling paint.   I hope I've conveyed my content mood.

When the last light of the day is catching the top of Half Dome and the peaks of the High Sierra in the distance everything just lights up.   Even the deep chasm below takes on beautiful blues and purples from the reflected light above.  During this sunset the obvious vistas were taken and a park ranger was providing a discussion session with the many tourist lined up against the walls of the path.   I was forced to try and find another location down below the rocks.    I was working my way down off the trial when by chance I found a location just below a large tree.   If I knelt down a bit it I was able to use a gap in the surrounding trees to gain a somewhat uniquely framed vista of the special scene before us.  Half Dome glowed brightly with the sunset and the last remnants of the thunderstorms earlier in the day added a special bit to the scene.   The tall pine trees caught the last bit of light slipping over the ridge behind us.    Off in the distance, just to the left of Half Dome and behind Clouds Rest looked especially nice.   I sat for a while with the wife and the pooch and just tired to relax and take in the whole scene.   But after a few minutes I had to jump back up as the scene had changed.    At the end of the day we were extremely tired but with a special contentment brought on by the scenes of the day.  I never regret going to Yosemite.    Even if it's  for a day and means getting up at 3AM and not getting to bed till 4AM the next day.   Darvin Atkeson LiquidMoonlight Studios"

Being alone, whether by circumstance or choice, is not tragic, as society conditions us to believe.

Their bodies are geared for ambling-type motion - not for speed. Thus, they are symbolic of patience and contentment - they are happy with being where they are, and are in no hurry for advancement. Further testimony to these attributes is the lack of evolution of the seahorse's body style. They have remained with this body style without change since their inception. Content to be who they are, and not feeling the need to change - these are a few profound lessons the seahorse provides us. However, along with a resistance to change, and a carefree approach to progress, the seahorse can be a symbol of inflexibility or stubbornness. To wit, the seahorse wraps its tail around the nearest object in order to anchor itself in turbulent waters. This is a lesson to be persistent in our goals, but be mindful that we are not too inflexible or stubborn in our achieving them.  A unique aspect of the seahorse is that the male is impregnated by the female and carries the offspring to term. This is a message of sharing the load in the home, and gaining perspective of both sides (genders) of an argument or situation.  The seahorse has a bony exoskeleton which is a message of protection. Often when the seahorse comes to us it is a sign that we either need protection from our external circumstances, or we are building walls that aren't needed. Their armor-bodies are a sign that sometimes we might need to let our guard down - or perhaps we are leaving too open to get hurt.  Lastly among the long list of symbolic meaning of the seahorse and its lessons is the idea of perception. The eyesight of the seahorse is incredibly sharp, and each eye moves independently. We take this as a symbolic message of perception and awareness of those around us and our situations. When we are lost or confused, the seahorse asks us to take a good look around - not just with our physical eyes but with our spiritual eyes in order to get a better perspective of the situation. www.whats-your-sign.com/symbolic-meaning-of-the-seahorse...."

Though we survived the alleged Mayan apocalypse, there were many tragedies and calamities, some too heartbreaking to contemplate  and some at a scale that affected millions.  But the Christmas story itself is anchored in tragedy. When God came down to Earth and became man in the form of the baby Jesus, there was a bloodbath and massacre of children initiated by a jealous ruler.  That's one reason why I like to think of joy as the heart of the season  not happiness. Joy is something that can only be acquired by those who have not only experienced happiness, but have endured pain and tragedy  Coming through it and arriving at a place of fulfillment and contentment. Joy exists not without pain, not even in spite of it, but it is been forged out of pain, Like gold in a smelting pot  the fire of circumstance eliminating the dross from our lives and helping us focus on that which is truly shining and valuable and eternal.  So, may you find and celebrate joy this seasonno matter what you have endured."

The problem inherent in looking outward for sources of happiness is that focusing on what you do not have or what you are not inevitably leads to unhappiness  It is easy to get caught up in your desires and to ignore the sources of joy and growth already present in your life. It is said that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. When you have stopped comparing yourself and your assets to others, you will be able to recognize that, to others, you are on the ""greener side"". Learning to live in te moment and enjoy your personal lot can be a source of profound contentment.  Unhappiness inspired by what you do not have is easy to overcome when you open your eyes to the wonderful things already present in your life. Remember that joy is a state of mind, and it is pointless to sacrifice the happiness of today for a set of possibilities that may or may not come to be.  p/s :Finally Danbo arrived! It was a long  day in campus until a parcel with a Japan stamp greeted me upon returning home. ^^"

I stayed up all night last night, got my drawing homework all done. I figured I'd take the opportunity to see sunrise in forsyth and finish up my Black & White homework (10 more shots to finish off the roll we're developing tomorrow in class) at the same time! So I walked all around the park and took a few hundred digital pictures and 8 film pictures. I'll upload my 15ish favorites to a set here on flickr in a bit. After my photowalk (during which I ran into paige, my RA also taking photos) I stopped at the quaint little forsyth cafe and got a hot chocolate and took an hour to read through another chapter in a book I'm working on, and also read through TIME magazine's story on Japan. What a moving story that was. It's unbelievable how even in this age where everything is connected so instantly, I feel so far away from the events in Japan. They won't affect my personal life for many months to come, but there's so much going on in Japan right now that has changed their day-to-day existenses more drastically than I could ever imagine. It's sad to me that even in the global culture we have, we still choose to live in our own little bubbles of contentment and security. There's so much we could be doing for the world, we're just not aware of what it is. Or I suppose that's how it seems to me at times. Either way, the rest of my day was: bike home, eat breakfast at scafe, fall asleep while watching the online stream of New Life Church, wake up exactly two hours later so I woke up during the second sermon of the morning right where I fell asleep in the first one. That was odd. Then I hit the sack till around 7 or 8, got up, sculpted my night away at boundary hall, went shopping at Kroger for misc snacks and failed to find the supplies I might need for tomorrow in class. I think I'll be okay though. Anyway, it's 11:30 now, and I think I'll go to bed again! I love sleep.  Sad that I missed playing HVZ today, I'm probably not #10 anymore :\  Also, I LOVE the colors in this picture. This is as close to real life as I could get it, and I think it's pretty darn close to the actual colors I saw as the sun hit the trees. With the one shortcoming that the tree in the sunlight was probably brighter than the screen you're viewing this on, it's pretty darn close. Yeah. Anyway, I found that shade of green pretty magical, so I went with this rather than all my black and white pictures from today as my picture! See ya tomorrow!"

The calm shade Shall bring a kindred calm, and the sweet breeze That makes the green leaves dance, shall waft a balm To thy sick heart. Thou wilt find nothing here Of all that pained thee in the haunts of men, And made thee loathe thy life. The primal curse Fell, it is true, upon the unsinning earth; But not in vengeance. God hath yoked to guilt Her pale tormentor, misery. Hence, these shades Are still the abodes of gladness; the thick roof Of green and stirring branches is alive And musical with birds, that sing and sport In wanttonness of spirit; while below The squirrel, with raised paws and form erect, Chirps merrily. Throngs of insects in the shade Try their thin wings and dance in the warm beam That waked them into life. Even the green trees Partake the deep contentment; as they bend To the soft winds, the sun from the blue sky Looks in and sheds a blessing on the scene. Scarce less the cleft-born wild-flower seems to enjoy Existence, than the winged plunderer That sucks its sweets. The mossy rocks themselves, And the old and ponderous trunks of prostrate trees That lead from knoll to knoll a causey rude Or bridge the sunken brook, and their dark roots, With all their earth upon them, twisting high, Breathe fixed tranquillity. The rivulet Sends forth glad sounds, and tripping o'er its bed Of pebbly sands, or leaping down the rocks, Seems, with continuous laughter, to rejoice In its own being. Softly tread the marge, Lest from her midway perch thou scare the wren That dips her bill in water. The cool wind, That stirs the stream in play, shall come to thee, Like one that loves thee nor will let thee pass Ungreeted, and shall give its light embrace. "

Its funny; after so many years working jobs that forced me into the habits of an early bird, my brain still refuses to work before midday. Early-morning starts coinciding with a shortage of coffee are so much the worse for everyone in the house! If Im working on a very detailed painting, a large body of work or thinking a lot about the pace and flow of a storyboard, I find myself getting very tired after a few hours. Napping in the afternoon is the only way I can switch my brain off.  Of course, its not really natural to sleep like this. Humans have something like a 90-minute sleep cycle, which goes through the motions of R.E.M., then a deeper sleep and then that sort of shallower window when you can resurface and feel refreshed; your bodys natural time to wake and use the stored energy in a useful way. Alarms interrupt all of this and can leave you feeling, well, alarmed. When I finally acknowledge the snooze button Ive already punched in a variety of inelegant ways particular to drunks and the sleep-deprived, it is dark outside. You wonder, for a moment, whether its morning or night and it dawns on you that it doesnt matter anyway since sleeping most of the day has not helped tick things off that growing to-do list. Time for Rabbit-Tea is about a mischievous rabbit and the mad things that happen inside your brain when time becomes fluid.

See map. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Wikipedia about Budai:  He is almost always shown smiling or laughing, hence his nickname the ""Laughing Buddha"". Budai is almost always represented as carrying a cloth or linen sack, which never empties, and is filled with many precious items, including rice plants (indicating wealth), sweets for children, food, small mammals, and the woes of the world.  Folklore: One belief surrounding the figure of Budai in popular folklore is that if a person is to rub his belly, it brings forth wealth, good luck, and prosperity. He is often admired for his happiness, plenitude, and wisdom of contentment."

Time is no longer of moment, for he has become part of space and freedom. He feels at last that he is down to the real business of living, that he has shed much that was unimportant and is in an old, polished groove of experience. Life, for some strange reason has suddenly become simple and complete  his wants are few, his confusion and uncertainty gone, his happiness and contentment deep.   There is magic in the feel of a paddle and the movement of a canoe, a magic compounded of distance, adventure, solitude, and peace. The way of a canoe is the way of the wilderness and of a freedom almost forgotten. It is an antidote to insecurity, the open door to waterways of ages past and a way of life with profound and abiding satisfactions.  Sigurd Olson, The Way of a Canoe, from Wilderness Days, 1956  Canoeing on the Mersey River in Kejimkujik National Park. (This one's for you, Alan - clearly a master of the art that Olson describes!)"

The calm shade Shall bring a kindred calm, and the sweet breeze That makes the green leaves dance, shall waft a balm To thy sick heart. Thou wilt find nothing here Of all that pained thee in the haunts of men, And made thee loathe thy life. The primal curse Fell, it is true, upon the unsinning earth, But not in vengeance. God hath yoked to guilt Her pale tormentor, misery. Hence, these shades Are still the abodes of gladness; the thick roof Of green and stirring branches is alive And musical with birds, that sing and sport In wantonness of spirit; while below The squirrel, with raised paws and form erect, Chirps merrily. Throngs of insects in the shade Try their thin wings and dance in the warm beam That waked them into life. Even the green trees Partake the deep contentment; as they bend To the soft winds, the sun from the blue sky Looks in and sheds a blessing on the scene. Scarce less the cleft-born wild-flower seems to enjoy Existence, than the wingd plunderer That sucks its sweets. The mossy rocks themselves, And the old and ponderous trunks of prostrate trees That lead from knoll to knoll a causey rude Or bridge the sunken brook, and their dark roots, With all their earth upon them, twisting high, Breathe fixed tranquility. The rivulet Sends forth glad sounds, and tripping oer its bed Of pebble sands, or leaping down the rocks, Seems, with continuous laughter, to rejoice In its own being. Softly tread the marge, Lest from her midway perch thou scare the wren That dips her bill in water. The cool wind, That stirs the stream in play, shall come to thee, Like one that loves thee nor will let thee pass Ungreeted, and shall give its light embrace.  -William Cullen Bryant"

We go strive for things we want to have or things that are not within our grasp yet. And sometimes when we finally have them, we don't know how to deal with it. We don't know how to feel contentment, or if could be we don't know how to handle power Or it could simply be we don't know how to be happy.  Life at my age is simple. Achieve what you can, cherish what you have. And  accept what you don't have yet. The sentence - One moment in time. For some, the key word could be time. They want to achieve as much within a period. For me, the key word is Moment. Cherish it.  Wait no more. Find no more. Seek no more. "

The perpetual ever-looming, always-changing 'there'.  But days like today make me think there just might be a chance I will. Days like today make me happy I didn't let my yesterdays ruin me. Days like today make me want to see tomorrow.    I'm wondering if all of my problems were caused by my bad sleep schedule. I've been on a day schedule for about a week now, and it's been a really happy, productive week.   I haven't had a horrific day in well over a month. ...that's nearing the ""earth-shattering"" status for me! I probably haven't had an official ""down"" period for nearly 4 or 5 months now. ...if it's to the point where I can't even pinpoint when it was, that's always a good sign.   It's strange. and kind of scary. but kind of exciting.  I'm finally starting to allow my hopes to get up. I've been so guarded from enjoying good times for what feels like years.   It's been nearly a decade since everything went to hell, seemingly over night.   ...it's been nearly half a decade since I was given the tools to pick up the pieces...  and it has only been within the last 4 or 5 months where I feel as though I'm finally starting to get a peek at stability. at life.    I hope and pray this isn't a false high, because it's the craziest, most wonderful feeling to finally have a sense of motivation. overall happiness. contentment. hope.   I've said it before...but I'm not allowing myself to go down again. Now that I've tasted stability, I never want to give it up. This time, I'm not going down without a fight.   I'm looking up, and for once, there isn't a ceiling of hurt, confusion, depression, or mania clouding my view. And it truly is a magnificent view!     I've been wounded I've been healed Now for landing I've been Landing I've been cleared  Sure as I'm breathing Sure as I'm sad I'll keep this wisdom In my flesh  I leave here believing More than I had This Love has got No Ceiling  - Eddie Vedder: No Ceiling (Into The Wild soundtrack)        But then I will win her back once again.       I will lead her into the desert       and speak tenderly to her there.   I will return her vineyards to her       and transform the Valley of Trouble into a gateway of hope.    She will give herself to me there,       as she did long ago when she was young,       when I freed her from her captivity in Egypt.  When that day comes, says the Lord,       you will call me my husband       instead of my master."" Hosea 2:14-16   ^ That's pretty much become my ""life verse"". Actually, Hosea 1:10-2:16 hits the hardest, but for brevity's sake I just did the last 3 haha.  At the end of Hosea 1 God opens up these lines of communication, basically saying that (paraphrasing) at the EXACT place where we parted ways, THAT is where we will come together. That really speaks true in a lot of ways in my life. He kind of revisits that idea in the next chapter with the verse I bolded. ""I will transform the Valley of Trouble into a gateway of hope""...He can redefine my experiences. Why haven't I allowed Him to?    I like it when God & I click. It makes life far more interesting and SO much better. I slack so so so so so bad...but man...I guess it's like my Grandma. I really love her. I do. And we normally have a good time together. But a lot of the time, I'm a horrible granddaughter and don't go down to her house for like a week or 2 (which is REALLY bad, because we only live 2 doors down). The love is there...the affection is there...the bond remains when I return...I just suck sometimes.    So now would probably be a good time to work on that..."

Cats are unlike any other animal domesticated by humans in that they came into our homes for food and no other reason. They make affectionate and loving pets, but still retain many of the features that allowed them to survive in the wild.  The domestic house cat is widely thought to have originated in Egypt approximately 3,600 years ago. Recent findings, however, suggest that domestic cats originated in the Middle East nearly 10,000 years ago. Researcher Carlos A. Driscoll concluded that every house cat in the world originates from a subspecies of wildcat found in the Middle East, Felis silvestris lybica. This conclusion was based on DNA samples taken from wildcats and domestic cats worldwide.  More than 30 percent of American households have cats, and more than 600 million cats live with humans worldwide. More than 35,000 kittens are born in the U.S. each year. Cats are an obviously important part of households in Western cultures, evidenced by an estimate that---as of the mid-1990s---services and products exclusively for cats had become a billion-dollar industry.  The Cat Fancier's Association, the largest cat registry in the world, recognizes 35 breeds of domestic cat. The International Cat Association, the second largest registry, recognizes 38 breeds. Genetically, all of these breeds are very similar, with the only differences being in features such as coat color and fur length and texture. There is a notable absence of the wide range of shapes, sizes and dispositions found in the breeds of dogs. This is due to all house cats having descended from a common ancestor, the Middle Eastern wildcat.  Domestic cats retain many of the features that aided their survival in the wild. They have excellent vision, and can see up to 120 feet away. Their peripheral vision is about 285 degrees, and they need only one sixth the amount of light that humans need in order to see, thus providing them with the ability to see well at night. Their hearing is sharp---a cat can hear sounds as high-pitched as 65 kHz (compared to a human's 20 kHz). A cat can pivot its ears 180 degrees, using 12 or more muscles to do so. Cats use 500 muscles to leap, jump and sprint. A cat can run as fast as 31 miles per hour.  A feature that makes cats favored pets is their ability to communicate their emotions and needs to humans. Cats have more than 100 vocal sounds. They will rarely meow at another cat; they reserve this sound exclusively for humans. Much of a cat's communication is done with its tail: a tail held high indicates happiness; a twitching or thrashing tail should be taken as a warning; and a tucked tail signals insecurity. When a cat jerks its tail from side to side, it indicates indecision. A sound individual to cats is the purr, which is created by contractions of the cat's diaphragm. While sometimes heard in anxious or ill cats, the purr is often a sign of contentment. "

We've seen plenty of them, narrow and rocky. In summer it's hardly a creek at all, but in the spring, it feeds a mighty river.  Each of us is like that creek, a trickle contributing to some greater plan. Sometimes we feel dried up, contributing nothing. Often we feel small, rocky, not up to the task - when we can understand what the task is.  Sometimes the task seems too simple - get up each morning, love and work and live the day as honestly as we can. What kind of contribution is that? Sometimes it seems too complicated. How much more we could contribute if we could see the whole river - where it begins and ends - if we knew what would happen tomorrow.  So we ebb and flow. And in our moments of contentment, we know we are doing the best we can each day.  "

Anthropy is thus every action of Man while on Earth  between fellow men and between men and the Planet. It is the relationship of all these actions with the vision of the Universe in which Man and Planet are found.  Entropy is the variation of energy in a system during any transformation  it is the same as the quantity of energy that the system exchanges with the environment. The first law of Entropy does not limit the possibilities of transforming one energy into another. This first principle establishes that energy cannot be created nor destroyed.  Garden is a word derived from Hebrew, comprising the prefix gan, which means protect or defend, implying a notion of enclosure or privacy, and the expression oden or eden, which transmits a sensation of pleasure or contentment.  The etymological interpretation of this word is reflected in the concept of privacy of land for leisure or contentment.  Gardens are an aesthetic expression of human ideas and a concrete expression of mans relationship with nature.  The forest represent the total phenomenon, it is nature in its greatest manifestation. The forest lays a role rich in meanings, which makes it a place of beginnings."

A little windy, but the temperatures were spring-like. Saturday night we went to see the legendary Von Freeman at Andy's Jazz Club. Together with a stroll around the River North area, it couldn't have been a better evening.  And yesterday it was a spur-of-the-moment photo meetup. I'd really wanted to go, but was looking for any excuse not to get out of my pajamas and out of the house. But a decision was made and I quickly brushed my teeth, got dressed and headed out. And I am so glad I did. It was a group of photographers that I'd never met before and it was billed as a CTA Tour of Chicago. We met at the historic Quincy Station (built in late 1890's) and rode the train around the city, stopping at various points to walk around and shoot. We stopped for coffee at a local coffee roaster, Asado half-way through to relax, talk and share what we had taken up to that point. We had some fantastic coffee and didn't stop shooting even while we were there.  It was such an amazing day. It was a great group and we had so much fun. It was a rare moment when we all weren't laughing and/or smiling. This was one of the places we stopped and I managed to squeeze in this quick selfie. The weather was so gorgeous that I was just carrying around my coat, but I put it on for the pop of color amid all the rust. Not crazy about my pose and expression, but it was just one shot. I set the 10 second timer, ran to my spot and called it ""good enough.""  It was another awesome weekend and I know that this coming weekend will be an incredible experience. Something I've been looking forward to for a long while now.  For Me Again Monday Theme for Monday November 14th - word  "

Intoxicating viewpoints, seducing entire civilizations.  Fallen Angels laughing at collective religious ignorance.Working, striving, accelerating, trying to keep up.  Thank God for the fire, the warmness and contentment.  Images of light coming to meet me.  A happy reunion, a friend long lost, victims of bad timing.  Lonely travels down the forlorn path Antecedents reminding me of how I could have done it better.  For the only way out is up and the only way up is through the fire.  Redwood trees and granite lead the way though it hardly seems real.  Watching in hiding, listening to the maddening sound of their voices singing through the air, shrill and hollow.  Singing a song about me.  Dancing naked knee deep in my blood.  Ruthless killers couldnt do better this,  though that is of little comfort now. Biting at the heels of contentment, Energy made manifest, seems like matter has betrayed universal law  Im not really sure what that means.  Probably nothing of consequence. Generations lamentations, devastations, spasmodic earth ever changing, rearranging, decks of cards not in order.  Chaotic scrimmages fighting against an invisible enemy steadily marching forward, never looking back.  Steady streams of malcontent effortlessly winding down the forlorn path.  Writhing under the pressure of time, withering bloody corpses of yesterday, today, tomorrow.  Existence as we know it ceases without warning, followed by evolutions, revolutions, new species doomed to repeat our past.  "

Every moment one lives is different from the other. The good, the bad, hardship, the joy, the tragedy, love, and happiness are all interwoven into one single, indescribable whole that is called life. You cannot separate the good from the bad. And perhaps there is no need to do so, either.""  - Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis"

Although they were predicting snow, it was not yet snowing in the morning so there was no reason to wear boots. Luckily I decided to throw them in the car just in case. This was taken around lunchtime today. Just one shot and I called it a day on the 366 project. I look a little grumpy I think, but I forgot to turn the volume back on on my phone so I couldn't hear if it went off. So that's my puzzled look. I'm glad that I took it when I did because as the snow continued, the wind really picked up and had blown it off of the trees. I like that you can see the snow blowing, too.  The roads were pretty treacherous on the way home, there were two accidents and I slid halfway through an intersection after I got off the expressway. It was all good. The other cars were paying attention and I blew my horn in case they weren't. I made it home in one piece. And I can work from home tomorrow!   For ODC - Making Tracks  "

Moss Landing built a visitor's boat dock right near the mouth of where Elkhorn Slough meets the Pacific Ocean.   I think the sea lions took over seconds after the ribbon was cut, or whatever people do to christen a boat dock.  Now, the sea lions are a tourist attraction.  And I am an super-tourist when I plunk down my tripod, 500mm lens with 2x teleconverter, and trusty D300.  I even had to play the warden role when some ""real"" tourists went down the closed off walkway to get within feet of the resting sea lions.  You see, there is this thing called the Marine Mammal Protection Act that forbids you to approach any marine mammal within so many feet.  I don't think 5 feet was the limit.  Anyway, the only real challenge to shooting these sea lions is the smell.  Just kidding, well, kind of.  Seriously though, I do find it challenging to find interesting compositions.  There are hundreds of sea lions, and although most are resting, they constantly change position.  It is a chaotic scene as they pile on top of each other and move into position.  If a scene presents itself, you must be quick to shoot, especially when you are manually focusing like I am.  And this was taken on Earth Day as well.  I could hear the sea lions barking on the offshore rocks during my kayak paddle before and after my dive, so I wanted some shots of my furry friends.
