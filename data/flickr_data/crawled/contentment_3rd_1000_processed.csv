Well today is a little more of a fashion shoot but still considering the concept of happiness shown by the beautiful smile, vibrant colors and great emotions. Since I started the 365, seems people started liking my shots (well me too) and seems most of the models out there are starting to notice me and asks me to do TFCD (Take for CD or a xdeal meaning I shoot them for free and give them the pictures in return) with them. Today as promised, I did a shoot with Genevieve Khoo, a model from Looque who have done a cover shoot for CLEO magazine some time ago. I was happy to have the opportunity as I don't usually get the chance to do shoots for models for their portfolios as they haven't noticed my work.

If you haven't seen her photostream, check it out.   This is Bobbie J, my 11 y.o. Blue & Yellow Macaw. Bobbie has multiple handicaps but is seemingly unaware. She and I became very, very close when she was just a little chick. She had operations on her feet and her beak and her eye and, consequently, became quite used to being handled. She trusts me, although after the many trips to the vet I don't know why, but she does.   The position in the photo is one that she initiated on her own and is very unnatural to a parrot. Nothing in their wild life would cause a parrot to lay still with their heads turned away like this. Parrots are prey animals and are very wary and alert to danger.   Bobbie has been and always will be the exception to so many rules. "

He came to us a rescue, a tiny ball of kitten with rich gray fur sticking straight out everywhere. His eyes were perfectly round and a crazy bright shade of yellow, shot through with orange and red zigzags.  A bit of his tail was AWOL, from an accident or genetics, we never knew. Not that it bothered him in any way during his 12 years of life  he carried on as if the full length of the appendage was still attached.  Ivan Stump Tail, he came to be known.  Ivan was a wild kitten, drag racing all over the apartments and houses we lived in, dive bombing the furniture, absolutely fearless. He was well traveled, living in Virginia, Oklahoma and a brief stint in sunny Florida, where he decidedly did not care for the local fire ants. OK, I made that part up  I'm the one who hated the little buggers, but could he chime in I am confident Ivan would have been in harmonious agreement.  He became younger friend to the long dearly departed Britches, elder brother to the half Siamese brothers, Nigel and Simon, and eventually a sort of bemused father to the now four year old Toby and Linus, also brothers (we are suckers at the animal shelter).  Ivan Stump Tail was a cheerful cat, a chirper and a squeaker, who would bang his head against the underside of the coffee table to announce his presence and demand attention. Truthfully he banged his head against just about anything  the wall, your leg, hand, whatever, it was his trademark. He had the smallest feet I've ever seen on an adult cat, which gave an appearance of delicacy. But he was anything but delicate. Ivan, though a bit on the small side, was a  fighter, a tough guy, the alpha cat amongst a pack of larger and younger felines. They all knew their place, and he never let them forget it.  Monday evening Ivan the invincible took ill. He spent two days in the hospital taking IV fluids and was diagnosed with a bum ticker and impending kidney failure. In typical Ivan fashion, he refused to participate in anything the vet wanted him to do, so she decided to send him home in a last ditch effort to see if he would eat on his own. Alas, he would not. Late yesterday he suffered what may have been a seizure, heart attack or some kind of stroke, collapsing and passing out for a minute or two. When he revived, he was a bit shaky, but recognized us and was able to walk and respond to our calls and petting. He was exhausted, it soon became apparent, preferring to stretch out on the floor, though he still kneaded the air with his tiny paws as we loved on him. But he was done.  His breathing was a bit labored, and he became quietly lethargic, so we called the vet and had her come to the house this early morning to send him on his way.  Ivan was unfailingly loyal, always up for a head rub or a back whapping, which would send him sliding across the carpet, powered by his front feet, a picture of perfect cat contentment. He was our Ivan, the Hoo-man, the Plush Cat, The Stump Tail. He caught the last train for the coast, and will be sorely missed.  See you in another life, brother."

The story is familiar  Everybody knows it well  But do other enchanted people feel as nervous  As I do?

And the quietness,  Yes, I like to be quiet  I am habituated  To a quiet life,    But always when I think these thoughts  As I sit in my well  Another thought comes to me and says:  It is part of the spell    To be happy  To work up contentment  To make much of being a frog  To fear disenchantment    Says, it will be heavenly  To be set free,  Cries, Heavenly the girl who disenchants  And the royal times, heavenly,  And I think it will be.

First I had to make sure that everything on my computer was backed up so I could install a new internal hard drive. The actual installation was easy, it's just after that I've been having to mess around with it. Originally, I made the new 3TB drive the boot drive and reinstalled Windows and everything from my recovery disks. Then when I booted back up, it only showed 734GB on the drive. Among other things, I found that Windows will only recognize 2TB on a boot drive. So I swapped the cables out and made the original drive the boot. So now, I'm trying to figure out how to have Windows recognize the entire 3TB on the new drive. I finally took a break to run to the grocery store and to take my picture for the day. And now I'm home and back at it. I'll get it figured out. Hopefully sooner than later!  Update: I got the drive fixed and I'm currently moving a big chunk of image files over to the new drive! Yay! (Adding my resolution here in case someone finds this post from Googling. I had updated all my drivers but that didn't seem to make any difference but I wanted to mention that in case it actually did affect the outcome. What I did was to uninstall the drive. In Computer Management>Device Manager>Disc Drives, I right-clicked on the Seagate drive and Uninstalled. Then using Seagate's DiscWizard I used Add New Disc to add the drive. The utility still partitioned it into two drives, first with 2TB and second with 746GB. Not sure why so much less than 1TB, but that seemed standard from what I read when I Googled.)  Have a great week!! It's a new week, new adventures!!  197/366    "

But today?  Today felt like it was making up in spades for her working yesterday.  It was one of those Sundays where soul-deep contentment can be found sitting on the couch with some quilting and hours and hours of Olympics on the TV.  Ahhhh.  Meanwhile, there has been an ongoing saga/running joke at Maple Hoo about how Boomer never sees bluebirds, while I see them all the time (they live all over my workplace campus).  So yesterday, while Pookie was at the office, Boomer exclaimed that there was an unusual and adorable bird out on the deck.  We marveled at its adorable little pom-pom shape and rusty neck... and then it flew off and that was that.  Hours later it dawned on me -- that was Boomer's first bluebird!  This afternoon, while we were in the living room, the bluebird returned.  And brought a handful of its friends.  It was like a bluebird army out in the yard -- seriously, there were about eight of them.  And they were annoying the living crap out of a robin that lives in the holly tree, because they'd keep amassing on the wires in front of the holly, then the robin would come out and chase them away, and then the bluebirds would return with even greater numbers.  It was almost bluebird overkill.  --Schn."

Every evening he would sit at the edge of the green field and eat. Then he would run across the field as fast as he could, jump into the woods, twirl around and run back  to his place in the tall grass.  One evening as he was eating, he saw a magnificent deer with large antlers come out of the woods and stand at the edge of the field.  He had heard the older rabbits talk of this animal but had never seen one.  That night Jonah decided that he wanted to become a deer.  He could think of nothing else.  So one morning he said goodbye to his family and friends and went into the woods.  Several days later he found the deer and began to follow him.  He even tried to prance and pretended he had antlers.  After some time had passed, Jonah actually began to believe he was a deer.  One day a group of hunters with their dogs came into the woods and suddenly the deer bolted and ran. Jonah tried to follow, but though he was a fast runner, he could not keep up.  He saw the deer stop and then leap across a fast moving stream.  Knowing he was a good jumper, Jonah leaped with all his strength but fell into the rapids and was swept downstream.  Finally he washed up onto a rock near the shore and pulled himself to safety, but not before almost drowning.  As he sat on the rock thinking about what had happened, he realized he was not a deer and became very sad.  A few minutes later he saw a squirrel running through the trees playing.  The more he watched, the more he realized how much fun the squirrel was having.  He decided thats what he wanted to be.  He ran to greet the squirrel and they played, chasing each other through the woods.  Jonah liked being a squirrel because they seemed to play all the time.  But after awhile Jonah realized that he could not climb trees, though he tried, and that the nuts the squirrel ate were too hard on his teeth.  Sadly he said goodbye and went deeper into the forest.   Jonah loved all the things he was learning.  He had many experiences and saw many beautiful places.  He tried to be just like every animal he met, believing he was their kind, even his mortal enemy the fox.  But after several years Jonah became very confused.  Early one spring morning while sitting under a large oak tree, he remembered the wide green fields and the tall grass along the fence row and the other rabbits he had left.  Suddenly he longed to be there.  He thought about the fresh green clover and the sunshine, his place along the fence row and his best friend, the old wise rabbit.  So looking around the beautiful forest and thinking about all he had learned, he said goodbye and ran toward the green field.    After running all day, Jonah arrived at the edge of the green field just as the sun was setting.  He paused, taking a deep breath, smelling the spring scent of new grass; he leaped for joy high in the air and ran across the field toward his place.  When he went into the tall grass, he found that his place was still there though in need of some repairs.  The next morning Jonah hopped out to the edge of the field to sit in the sunshine.  When his friends and family saw him, they ran and greeted him warmly.  There were many new rabbits that Jonah did not know.  The rest of the day was spent sitting in the tall grass and talking with everyone.  Jonah discovered that many of the rabbits had also left  to live in other places, one at the edge of a pond on a nearby farm, another in a barn with soft hay, and yet another on a hillside full of briars where he felt protected.  But unlike him they had not become confused about who they were. He also discovered that the rabbits he did not recognize were from places he had heard about but could only hope to visit.    So it was decided by all the rabbits that in the evenings they would gather in a circle in the green field and tell of their experiences, the places where they had lived and visited and what they had learned.  The old wise rabbit would be in charge of the conversations so that everyone did not talk at once.  He would call on someone to start and then everyone would have a chance to speak.  All those who had left shared about what their lives had been like when they were gone, returning because they missed the tall grass and their places.  The new rabbits had come from far away and decided to live in the tall grass after visiting for awhile.  Jonah thought them fascinating because they told of things he had never imagined.    So each evening the wise old rabbit would call on someone to start the conversation.  Jonah soon found that this had become his favorite part of the day.  He looked forward to hearing the stories and learning many new things.  He realized that what all the other rabbits had done and thought was so interesting that he could sit for the rest of his life in the evening circle. He also knew that some would leave for new places but others would visit and some would stay.  Later that night unable to sleep, Jonah sat in the tall grass and looked at the twinkling stars.  It was a cold clear winter night and the wind was blowing above his head.  Suddenly a warm feeling came over and through his body and he was filled with joy and contentment for the first time.  He knew for certain that he was a rabbit, and that he loved being a rabbit.  He knew he was born to run.        mBarlew    Note:  I want to thank all of my dear Flickr friends who take the time to visit and share your life and your stories.  I can sit for the rest of my life listening to you in ""the evening circle.""            "

Lions are primarily nocturnal, although seem to be most active at twilight.   The African lion is the only large cat that is social. Lions  live in groups which are called prides. All of a prides lionesses are related. At Lion camp, the Male is Izu. the two females are Oshana and Mina, and they are sisters.   Lions are the only members of the cat family to display obvious sexual dimorphism  that is, males and females look distinctly different. They also have specialized roles that each gender plays in the pride. For instance, the lioness, is  the hunter, while the male Lion stands guard patrolling their territory to defend it from intruders.  Africa's lions are considered to be threatened by their environment because of habitat loss, loss of prey and increased human-lion conflicts, according to The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

It has been at the park for the last several weeks hanging out at the Log Cabin Replica and the Old Church. I often have lunch in this area and lately I have been sharing my lunch with my new friend. I have named her Belle. In this photo, Belle has just finished eating and has retreated back to her favorite spot in the breezeway of the cabin. The thing that strikes me about this photo is the contentment that is displayed by Belle which reminds me that the time it takes for us to reach contentment is inversely related to the time we spend being happy.   A youthful mind is seldom totally free from ambition; to curb that, is the first step to contentment, since to diminish expectation is to increase enjoyment. - Frances Burney   Olympus OM Zuiko 300mm f4.5 MC (1/60, f5.6, ISO 1600)"

Shops for pain, sorrow, bitterness and heartbreak Shop around - it's not to late. Shops for joy, happiness, contentment, devotion Shops for every emotion.  Stop in - look around - feel every emotion That can be found. Shop around ahead of time To find out what awaits down the line.  But do not be fearful of pains That may await Take the chance - don't hesitate.

If I had a day off every week, I might be able to get and stay organized. Probably not. I'd spend that day doing something fun instead.  Anyway, I did get a boatload of things accomplished today. And in my organizing, I found a book on CD in my old car that was a loaner from the library. I decided to go over there and turn myself in. The woman at the library scanned the code, but nothing was coming up, she tried again. She tried typing in the numbers. Nothing. Not recognized at all. I told her that maybe there was a warrant out because I'd had it so long. She laughed and said that perhaps they charged my library card for the book. She checked that and my card was clean. No charges and no holds. She told me that maybe I should go play lotto. And she told me not to forget who suggested that. So, when I left the library I went and bought a lotto ticket for tonight. I probably won't check it for a couple months though.    81/366   . . I would like to thank everyone who have made donations already. I really appreciate it.

Sometimes we see children dressed up as soldiers for Halloween. The image of the real child soldier from Africa was put into a group of Trick or Treaters in North America. The child soldier seems to blend in with the crowd of children in their costumes. This work tries to brings up an ethical issue of whether or not it is right for adults to let children play with games involving war. This work also emphasizes how the child soldier is really still a small child, just like all the other children he is surrounded by. He has the rights to play and have fun during his childhood too. He should not be forced into becoming a soldier. "

Situated 45 km from Leh, the monastery was established in 1672 by the Ladakhi king Senge Namgyal.  This young man is a monk, when I first saw him he was blowing into a spectacular Rag-Dung trumpet during a ceremony which was taking place in the inner courtyard of the monastery. The loud engrossing sound has the amalgamation of mystery and produces meditative, imagination and healing power.   Later we spoke of several things while he took us inside the building in order to visit a few temples and museum. I did several pictures of him, sometimes it was difficult as he has a very solar personality and he has many expressions,  he knew that I wanted him to smile and he gave me many smiles but I selected this portrait  where he is very quiet, maybe this is his inner side. I wish I could have spent more time with him, there was so much of happiness, contentment and felicity around him, I was happy to feel all this. He might read those words as I gave him the link of this website and I want to thank him again for the time he gave us and to tell him that I am printing and sending him the pictures very soon.

Over the years I have heard artists and musicians talk about their art form being their release and thought it was all nonsense and in fact, I never even knew what people meant when they spoke about having a release.   A release from what?   I have spent a good part of my life chasing illusive ideals and in recent years, in the pursuit of those ideals, I have invested unmeasurable effort and energy and have made some very big mistakes. The saddest part is - I am not one bit closer.   The honest and depressing truth is that contentment and happiness cannot be travelled to, owned or earned, you cant buy it or persuade it to come to you and even hard work wont do it for you.   Its funny how at every stage in our life we think we know the answers, that we are, at that very point in time, empowered with the ability to discern or judge what is true, right or lasting for ourselves and for others. I envy those who are truly and utterly happy in their self and have the wisdom to make the right decisions even when they have no idea that they are in the moment where the right decision matters so much.   So what is this release? I still have no idea. Im not claiming to be a great photographer and maybe not even a photographer at all but I do know that it is the one safe outlet I have to make all the mistakes I want with no consequences.  You will never know it and you'll never even see this but to the mistakes I have made chasing those illusive ideals, this old bridge, somewhere in a South Korean forest, is dedicated to you babe."

Here on a chilly weekday morning, all he needed was his coffee, his tea and a moist, warm bun. That was happiness, a solitude that needn't be dignified with a smile. Smiles to him were a chore, a more-than-often sarcastic gesture used too extravagantly. His smile was only reserved for his better half; the endearing face he used to wake up to; the missing piece in his fatigued clockwork. But until his creaky clock stops, he is content to just milk the inexplicable joy from his simple meal."

New days full of eager audiences waiting in breathless anticipation, the bleachers are always full.  Popcorn and cotton candy in the bellies of happy children.  But the arena is empty and the air is stifled with the thick blanket of indifference.  The soil stained with the blood of old soldiers, ghosts of the soulless regime. Intoxicating viewpoints, seducing entire civilizations.  Fallen Angels laughing at collective religious ignorance.Working, striving, accelerating, trying to keep up.  Thank God for the fire, the warmness and contentment.  Images of light coming to meet me.  A happy reunion, a friend long lost, victims of bad timing.  Lonely travels down the forlorn path Antecedents reminding me of how I could have done it better.  For the only way out is up and the only way up is through the fire.  Redwood trees and granite lead the way though it hardly seems real.  Watching in hiding, listening to the maddening sound of their voices singing through the air, shrill and hollow.  Singing a song about me.  Dancing naked knee deep in my blood.  Ruthless killers couldnt do better this,  though that is of little comfort now. Biting at the heels of contentment, Energy made manifest, seems like matter has betrayed universal law  Im not really sure what that means.  Probably nothing of consequence. Generations lamentations, devastations, spasmodic earth ever changing, rearranging, decks of cards not in order.  Chaotic scrimmages fighting against an invisible enemy steadily marching forward, never looking back.  Steady streams of malcontent effortlessly winding down the forlorn path.  Writhing under the pressure of time, withering bloody corpses of yesterday, today, tomorrow.  Existence as we know it ceases without warning, followed by evolutions, revolutions, new species doomed to repeat our past.  "

The weather site said that my destination was ""clear"" so I threw a small tent and some gear into my car and headed out. I called the state park from the road and they couldn't guarantee a spot, I would just have to see if there were any available when I got there. As I drove the sky started getting cloudy but I continued on, trusting that my night would end up to be just what it needed to be (or that I would make the best of whatever happened). I arrived and was able to pick out a spot where I promptly got my tent setup. It was cloudy and since it looked like I'd be spending the evening around a fire, I headed back out to get some firewood and some adult beverages. On my way, I noticed a spectacular sunset and then came to a spot where I could pull over and view it from. I stayed there watching the entire sunset show, taking some pictures and feeling so grateful to be there. There's a link to one of my shots in the comments. A while after I had gotten back (and after this shot), I noticed that the sky was clearing up. I drove out to a wide open area in the campground and parked my car. There were a gazillion stars in the sky (sprinkled with light clouds here and there, making it not good for star trails). I took a big blanket out of my trunk and put it on the roof of the car, where I laid watching the sky for a long while making some wishes while I was there.  It turned out to be a very soul-filling night.    .  Andy Grammer - Miss Me  .   259/366   "

When I got home our lovely new sofas had been delivered and in place (you can see a bit in the pic)  Also the first batch of our Next sale purchases had arrived so I spent a while sifting through and trying bits on.

Sometimes you enter the house and soundlessly sit down at the piano, not bothering to unbutton your coat, dropping your keys with a clang of metal on the wooden seat beside you. They gleam.  You put your fingers to the keys and pound out a melody, pretending that the tinny song of our out of tune piano is a replacement for the words you cannot find. The notes are cheap and shrill on the piano but the emotion runs deeper, like blood in your veins.  I stand in the doorway, leaning against its pane, watching as you play, watching as you struggle to hear words over your imagined symphony. You catch me there, trapped like a snapshot in the door frame. Looking up, eyes nail me in place; they are so naked and startled  the same empty blue of unwashed skies and your Oxford shirt  that I am ashamed for you, of you.  But I cannot find the words anymore than you.  I leave the room. And your haunting music follows me through the thin walls.   "

This couple was on the ice rink at Millennium Park. Shot at 50mm, so I was that close to them. They were so beautiful and I was so touched.  I don't know why couples are hesitant to display emotion like this. I think if we saw this kind of affection displayed, it would ripple and spread peace, joy and love.     "

Within this collection, it is such photographs as the one being viewed that are the most valuable.  They defy stereotypes and the often negatively racially slanted narrative about Afro American opinions on same-sex affection ""historically"" within the community.  The Afro American community (outside the usual vociferous gang of self-rightious, hypocritical thugs) has a long history showing an acceptance of many ""male"" same-sex couples.   Yet the media will focus on those men who had the misfortune of living in homophobic circles for some length of time and portray their word as the literal gospel on the black view of same-sex living.   Those who have found contentment and have not divorced themselves from the community are largely ignored."
