I went on a hike on the path ""cao negro"" which was much longer than epected and in pretty wet conditions. Nonetheless, the hike in new territory seeing and being in a new space is always good for the mind. After my journey to Monteverde, I went to the small town of La Fortuna. On my departing journey from Monteverde, there had to be at least 15 rainbows or ""arcoiris"" ...incredible. The locals there find it comical when others marvel at the rainbows...its a common occurrence in Monteverde...with clear skies and rainbows galore...it set the pace for my descending trip from the cloud forest. La Fortuna's landscape is dominated by Volcn Arenal. I was told 80% of people who visit La Fortuna actually get to see the full view of the volcano as there are too many clouds. I was fotunate to be able to see the whole thing and wow what a sight. If you havent seen a volcano as I hadn't, it is awe inspiring, such a massive feature in the landscape. After sleeping a night, the next day I hiked around the Volcano and got to see a nice view of the valley and Lake. Afterwards in the evening, I went to a natural hotspring river where the water was a pleasantly hot temperature and relaxed."

The largest of the streams that flow into the lake, the Savica ('little Sava'),is fed from rno jezero (Black Lake), the largest lake in the Triglav Lakes Valley. The outflow at the eastern end is the Jezernica creek which merges with the Mostnica to form the Sava Bohinjka, which in turn becomes the larger Sava River at the confluence with the Sava Dolinka. As found out already by Belsazar Hacquet in the 18th century, much more water leaves Lake Bohinj than enters it, which is explained with subterranean sources of water. The clear waters are the habitat of brown trout, burbot, European chub, common minnow and Arctic char, eight genera of molluscs, as well as of numerous algae species. It is a popular day trippers' destination for swimming and other water sports. On the shore is a statue of the legendary Goldhorn (Zlatorog) chamois, whose story was perpetuated by the poet Rudolf Baumbach."

Although far beyond the peak season of May through early July, we decided to take a drive over after visiting Duke Farms (see our ALBUMS) during a late mid-August day.   We had been told about this lovely garden by a number of folks we had met over a week period earlier that month, and since the descriptions were consistently very appealingbased on peak season, in each casewe felt it would be worth the 6 or 7 miles from Duke Farms, for we had nothing to lose.  Basically, we just wanted to get an idea as to the general layout of the place for future consideration.  We were a bit skeptical in terms of expectations, having been spoiled by numerous visits to Longwood Gardens (see ALBUM for this site, too) in PAperhaps the greatest garden in North America with its over 1,000 acres of spectacular displays. Well, upon arriving later that day, we could instantly tell that this new garden would be special.  From the parking area, once notices the elegant layout of the enclosed rose garden, and even at this time of year, it was evident from a distance that many roses were still quite nice.  As we approached the gate, the roses still peaking were simply stunning.  Granted, not Longwood Gardens in scale, but with a focus on roses, it is definitely first class, and we could easily see the incredible passion administered by the gardeners and horticulturists.  Many of these roses were given official names, designated as unique species.  Most fell under the families of Grandiflora and Floribunda Roses, and for the most part, my wife was very diligent about notating the exact names and families.  I, on the other hand, was somewhat remiss in that several truly wonderful roses photographed toward the latter part of this visit were without detailed IDs.   Anyhow, we can only imagine what the scenery might be during the peak blooms, and we definitely intend to return to experience it.  For those residing in the New Jersey or Eastern PA regions, this is a MUST SEE place.  And if roses are amongst your favorite flowers, you will be in awe. "

This was my second night shooting the stars along the Big Sur coast. I almost called it quits due to the howling winds, but found a few boulders that blocked the wind enough to allow me to shoot. It was crystal clear for the first few minutes of shooting, but once again some crazy thin clouds began streaming in. In my opinion the clouds add a surreal feeling to this Pfeiffer Beach Milky Way shot. I felt very fortunate to have some fairly clear skies along a typically foggy coastline during  this time of the year. There was a low fog bank, which you ca see, lingering off shore the entire night, but it never came in.  On this shoot I was alone, and in awe as the Milky Way lined up over the iconic Pfeiffer Beach rock.  Myself, being a sci-fi geek, couldnt help but imagine the cave being a portal to the universe during the moment of the celestial alignment; just step through the keyhole, and you are traveling through a wormhole to another part of our galaxy. I was hoping that the clouds would stay for sunrise, but they cleared about five minutes before burn time.  Funny how that often seems to happen. I'm leaving the white balance on the cool side out of personal preference.  Wishing everyone a fantastic week!  Nikon 14-24mm @ 15mm."

Some of these renowned sights are the Arena, sixth largest in the world or Twin Gates, the Temple of Augustus, the well-preserved Roman Forum or the Communal Palace. However, not as much information is known about the impressive heritage of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy dating from the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, undoubtedly a real cultural and historic treasure. In fact, this refers to entire Pula, which from 1820 to 1916 was being architecturally shaped as a fortified town. Once the major naval port of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy Pula, together with its surroundings, has kept for over a century 26 magnificent forts or fortifications, as well as 8 artillery batteries, about 60 batteries, trenches, underground tunnels and many other points of interest. The outer ring of Pula's fortifications covers an area of 40,000 hectares and according to legend all forts were interconnected by a network of underground tunnels. Especially interesting is the story according to which Fort Marie Louise at Muzil was connected with the fort on the Brijuni islands by an underwater tunnel.  Pula's fortifications were designed to defend the city from possible attacks from the sea and were built to resist every possible attack - for this reason they were mostly circular or ring-like so that shells could rebound off the walls. They were all built at excellent locations, mostly lookouts that even today offer a magnificent view.  The fortifications of Pula and its surroundings were never used for a specific attack and defense of the city, although according to some sources, in 1915 Pula's garrison consisted of as many as 1,410 officers and over 51 thousand soldiers. Owing to the fact that the forts were never attacked from the sea, today Pula has a completely preserved significant fortification complex. "

I love to find beautiful scenes just as they are, without adding filters, retouching, manipulation and using only available light.

Im never happier than when I have my camera with me and Im shooting. Then I forget my backs broken (yes, I can walk), that some things worry me, that things arent as theyre supposed to. When Im taking photographs, life is perfect, joyful, Im in awe of the things I find, and Im always moved by life and beauty on this planet.

The largest single story building in the world.    This is where the giant Saturn V rockets of Apollo and the boosters for Shuttle were assembled vertically indoors.  The internal volume is so vast that it has its own weather!    On humid days, rain clouds form just below the yellow crane mounts you see up there.  To control moisture, the VAB has 10,000 tons of air conditioning equipment, including 125 ventilators on the roof.   Think of it as fitting almost four Empire State Buildings inside.  One detail that few know about: if you climb on the roof, you will see that the steel girders protrude through the roof by a few feet (a non-deal roof design, as they have to be slathered with waterproofing over the years to keep watertight).  Why?  Well, when they were building the VAB, Werner Von Braun was not completely certain that the Saturn V as specified would have enough thrust to get the job done.  So they built the VAB with the option to add an additional 100 ft. to its already prodigious height.  (click photo to enlarge - it's 21 megapixels.  Some other shots below)"

The original old growth forest in this part of Vancouver Island is long gone. It's puzzling to see this giant tree, so easily accessible from the road, continue its healthy growth skyward. It's over 80 meters tall and wider than our car. The thick mossy branches are larger than most tree in the rest of North America.  It's well over 200 years old and will probably live for hundreds more. Even though it's not protected in a provincial park, the respect and awe from visitors and locals will probably let it be.

Cloudy sky - The Mediterranean with Mount Agde, 1857 by Gustave Le Gray (French, 1820 - 1884) - Albumen print from two glass negatives -  Le Gray's monumental seascapes stunned his contemporaries. Early photographers struggled to record the lighter tonalities of sky and the darker earh in the same negative, and they sought to counter the blank or slightly mottled skies that were the norm. Le Gray solved this problem by adding a second negative that he carefully pieced into the image in the printing process. The immensity and drama in these works evoke a sense of awe that relates to Late Romantic painting.  Source: Boston Museum of Fine Arts"

The opening ceremony was attended by Liz Tory, Jim Pattison Sr., Jim Pattison Jr. (President of Ripley Entertainment), Mayor Rob Ford, and Sport and Tourism Minister Michael Chan, as well as media from around the country.   The new aquarium is designed to submerge visitors into the watery world that lies beneath our city - the multi-facetted shell takes its inspiration from glacial formations sprung out of the earth through tectonic shifts, and the glass wall surrounding the main entrance gives visitors the illusion of having a glimpse underneath the earths crust into the aquatic world. The experience is further heightened by allowing for observation from above, below and within. Pop-up tanks, crawl-through tunnels, and domes allow viewers to be submerged within the exhibits, heightening the sense of exploration and discovery.   The experience is certainly proving to have an awe-inspiring effect on visitors. Said one Toronto Star reporter, At this aquarium, with its three-metre long sharks, sawfish, a lobster the size of a great dane, a grouper as big as a couchhypnotism by sea creatures is a serious risk.   B+H was responsible for architecture, programming, and coordinating the work of the many specialty consultants required on the project. Holding over 5.7 million litres of water and housing over 450 species of marine animals, the project required a unique approach and great technical innovation. One of the most complex requirements is the Life Support System (LSS) for the tanks, which cleans and recycles nearly all of the water for the aquatic habitats, ensuring water usage within the building is remains low.   Additional technical challenges included the complex concrete framework required for the free-form design of the tanks, and balancing the use of daylight where possible with the requirement for absolute light control in the exhibits to protect the inhabitants  which was achieved through conducting careful studies of daylight and the incorporation of several light locks.   Following B+Hs work on the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Royal Ontario Museum, and the Metro Convention Centre, this is yet another major cultural and entertainment landmark in Toronto that the firm has played an important role in creating. Situated at the base of the CN tower between the Rogers Centre and the Convention Centre, the aquarium reinforces this area as a destination district, providing the highest quality environmental education in a richly entertaining complex.   B+H is proud to have played a part in the creation of a facility that is both adds to the Toronto landscape as well as attracting visitors from around the world with its innovative approach and immersive experience.   - See more at: www.bharchitects.com/en/news_stories#sthash.zZQNFegE.dpuf  in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

THE TOWER STANDS FURTHER BACK FROM THE COAST THAN THE CURRENT LIGHTHOUSE, FLAMBOROUGH HEAD LIGHTHOUSE,WHICH DATES FROM 1806. ITS LOCATION SUGGESTS THAT SAILORS WOULD HAVE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO SEE THE COAL POWERED LIGHT IN POOR VISIBILITY. "

awe,http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7353/9283216928_57e41a5c89_z.jpg,2,3,"Chapel Ceiling, Tile Cross Our Lady Help of Christians RC at Kitt's Green, in the Tile Cross area of Birmingham is a stunning late 1960s Catholic church by Richard Gilbert Scott and very inventive, on a T-shaped plan with a ribbed roof that curve upwards, rising to form a central tower over the core of the building. Not everyone will find this attractive, but I actually find it all the more remarkable for it.  Copious quantities of stained glass is visible in the windows and weirdly shaped apertures, but alas I was out of luck as it was all locked up. There was a notice directing people wishing access to the church to the priest's house behind it, but I could tell my efforts were in vain as my appeal to look inside was met with a puzzled frown and a suggestion that I come back for mass the following morning. He was perhaps busy which is fair enough, but for me living nearly 20 miles away returning wasn't so simple.   I wasn't overly keen on looking around after a service, the timings didn't suit my trains and it would be likely busy, so when I saw 'confessions' listed 11-12 Saturday mornings thought that might be a better bet. Turned up to find the church was open but with a few people (inc. the priest I'd met before, who I didn't think would be overly keen to see me loitering again) sitting or kneeling quietly inside, I realised it was now exposition of the Blessed Sacrament instead. A very awkward time to look around, I'd have to content myself with quietly keeping out of the way in the chapels at the back and get some pics of their windows at least, but this wasn't enough for one member of the flock who noticed me and glared in a 'How dare you enter our church!' kind of way! I retreated out of sight into the baptistery to sit and look at a fine abstract window, but he decided to come and stand staring aggressively opposite me and clearly wanted to start something, but the atmosphere of awed silence prevented this and he left, but he'd made his point, I knew I was not welcome in this church.  I left shortly afterwards myself feeling frustrated (for the second time, not having been able to view or record the full interior) and deeply uncomfortable. I was hoping to bump meet my would-be assailant outside, having mentally prepared some suitable Biblical quotes about Christian behaviour since he displayed so little of it, but it was  most likely just an all too common case of being judged guilty of whatever before proven innocent.   So to summarise, this is one of the most remarkable modern church buildings I've seen, but from my experiences also just about the most unwelcoming I've ever visited. I'm sure, with hindsight, staying after a mass would have been a far better choice after all, reception might have been different (certainly couldn't be worse)."

Their displays of asters are one of the best in the country. This photo shows one of their stock beds, with plants being grown for sale.  The English herbaceous border in full flower is a breath taking and awe inspiring sight. When done on a grand scale its a true marvel of what skilled designers and gardeners can achieve. To construct an herbaceous border on the scale shown in these photos requires sufficient space, adequate manpower and resources and detailed horticultural knowledge too.    2014 ukgardenphotos   "

I went on a hike on the path ""cao negro"" which was much longer than epected and in pretty wet conditions. Nonetheless, the hike in new territory seeing and being in a new space is always good for the mind. After my journey to Monteverde, I went to the small town of La Fortuna. On my departing journey from Monteverde, there had to be at least 15 rainbows or ""arcoiris"" ...incredible. The locals there find it comical when others marvel at the rainbows...its a common occurrence in Monteverde...with clear skies and rainbows galore...it set the pace for my descending trip from the cloud forest. La Fortuna's landscape is dominated by Volcn Arenal. I was told 80% of people who visit La Fortuna actually get to see the full view of the volcano as there are too many clouds. I was fotunate to be able to see the whole thing and wow what a sight. If you havent seen a volcano as I hadn't, it is awe inspiring, such a massive feature in the landscape. After sleeping a night, the next day I hiked around the Volcano and got to see a nice view of the valley and Lake. Afterwards in the evening, I went to a natural hotspring river where the water was a pleasantly hot temperature and relaxed."

I can only imagine how awesome it must feel to be able to ride one of these that well.  My husband can do loops, I'm very proud to watch him do something so amazing and skilled.

I have also always wanted to shoot light coming in beams through trees along a dirt road.  Combine those two and this is what I created!  Once again Ethan Coverstones farm was the perfect set of locations for the Midwest Flickr Meetup.  Although I am not a formal dancer of any genre, I love the release you can get from expressing feeling through movement.  Next time you have the opportunity to dance, whether alone or in public, dont clam up or pass the opportunity- free yourself and just get into it.  It may sound cheesy but it is the best feeling in the world! To see more photos from the meetup by everyone involved, follow the link below.  Also thank you times a MILLION to the incredible Rachel Baran for driving my van like a mad boss down the road to create the dust!  CHECK OUT EVERYONES MEETUP PHOTOS HERE!

Some people would look at the state of our yard and the inside of our house and say,( I have a few people in mind), that we were definitely wasting time gallivanting around instead of tending to the obviously needed yard work and  home owner maintenance.  Anyway, I love photo processing, cause I can sit on my ass, drink beer and listen to music while I'm doing it.  What's adds to that  fun is having some new photo editing  software like Photoshop CS6 beta.   One of the nice new filters  that I like  is ""Oil Paint"" which I used on this image.  If you stand back it's not so obvious but works well in my opinion.  Zoom in and the brush strokes become much more obvious. Below is the original raw image I started out with before I started drinking beer and wasting time.    Happy Hump Day!!!"

The rocky mountains are impressive everywhere you can see them, I went from Yoho National Park in BC through to Banff and Jasper National Parks in Alberta and back through southern BC here at the Crowsnest Pass.  It's an awe inspiring sight to see the front rages of the Rockies every time. I first saw the Rocky mountains on a family trip in Colorado when I was a teenager and was mightily impressed then too."

I suppose technically I'm braking the rules, because I took this shot last week, and not today, for my final photo. But really, it's the perfect photo for me to finish this project with, because without  having participated in Souvenir Foto School, I wouldn't have maniacally pulled off the road at 50mph to capture this sight. I think that offsets the fact that I'm bending the rules here.  It was serendipity, this sunset moment, and bitter sweet at the same time. With an unexpected and sudden passing,  we headed straight up to Oklahoma to be with family and celebrate a wonderful person's life. Driving along a long country road, we couldn't help noticing how beautiful the sky was, tinged with purple and orange. I knew there weren't going to be many sunsets like the one we were experiencing and I frantically searched for a place to pull off the road so I could try to take some pictures. We finally happened upon a church, of all places, and pulled into its long drive. When we parked, we saw the most amazing sight: a small hill overlooking a pond reflecting the most magnificent sky I've ever laid eyes upon! My husband and I stood there in quiet awe as we silently gave thanks for each other and for this life.   I took so many pictures, not only to capture the beauty to share with others, but to be able to hold onto that moment and that feeling forever. It was a tough decision to pick just one of the photos; to me, they all represent the perfect ending to a February full of challenge and growth, ever-changing in color, composition and pattern. www.flickr.com/photos/suswins/sets/72157629126178826/  Thank you all for your comments and support through this photographic adventure.

That's how long after the previous photo this one was taken.  Early morning in Gambier Bay, Admiralty Island in Stephens Passage, Alaska.  A final footnote. I was transfixed for the couple of hours of this series of photos, just watching the changing light and  scenery unfold before me; it was so beautiful and awe inspiring. Around the time that I was taking this photo a fellow traveller came up to me and said, ""Bleak isn't it?"" then shrugged his shoulders and shuffled off inside. Maybe beauty really is in the eye of the beholder. "

Jay and I had just reached level ground in the high valley mentioned in the previous post when we stopped for a break. Sitting in silence on the banks of a singing mountain stream we looked back at the way we'd come and saw this view, a view that had nothing in common with what we'd seen of it prior to starting up the path some twenty minutes before. Our first glimpse of this scene had been of totally clagged out mountain tops, the clag only broken in a few places by exposure meter busting holes, lit from behind by a low sun. There was no chance of creating any kind of photograph that wouldn't have resulted in black as pitch shadows or super nova highlights. Deep down though, I knew things could change rapidly, hopefully, while we were still in a position to see the drama unfold.  Sure enough, things did change, the wind picked up, the light and temperature dropped and the clouds were getting up to misty mischief with the sun and mountains. We were entranced by the scene and enthralled by the wild balletic behaviour of the clouds, which seemed to be happening in graceful slow motion because of our distant viewpoint. We watched with child-awed intensity as wispy snakes of cloud writhed around the steep, rocky flanks of the mountains while higher cloud circled menacingly, dark behemoths of the sky dancing a storm dance with their earthbound partners. I turned to Jay and said, with an almost reverential whisper lest the clouds might catch my voice on the wind and take flight, ""Clouds. The only things that can make a mountain seem small and insignificant. And the only things that can bring out the beauty and soul of a mountain"".  I love clouds. I love mountains. Put the two together "

According to legend, it was here, in the awe-inspiring basin at the mountain's summit, that the demigod Maui snared the sun, releasing it only after it promised to move more slowly across the sky. Haleakal means ""house of the sun""; the park encompasses the basin and portions of the volcano's flanks.  A United Nations International Biosphere Reserve, the park comprises starkly contrasting worlds of mountain and coast. The road to the summit of Haleakal rises from near sea level to 10,023 feet in 38 milespossibly the steepest such gradient for autos in the world. Visitors ascend through several climate and vegetation zones, from humid subtropical lowlands to subalpine desert. Striking plants and animals such as the Haleakal silversword and the nn may be seen in this mountain section.  The summit-area depression, misnamed Haleakal Crater, formed as erosion ate away the mountain, joining two valleys. This 19-square-mile wilderness area, 2,720 feet deep, is the park's major draw.  From east of the rim, the great rain forest valley of Kpahulu drops thousands of feet down to the coast. The upper Kpahulu Valley is a biological reserve (no public access), home to a vast profusion of flora and fauna, including some of the world's rarest birds, plants, and invertebrates. Some insects and plants evolved in the Kpahulu Valley and live nowhere else. "

Visitors to the capitol enter into the awe-inspiring rotunda, surmounted by Gilbert's massive dome. Above arched niches and entrances to the legislative lobbies are rows of marble moldings and friezes, above which windows allow light to pour into the dome, whose ceiling of plaster is coffered and painted in a deep blue.

At the foot of the fortified rocks 609.6 meters above the sea level stands the town of Bhongir, it has a unique egg-shaped construction with two entry points protected by huge rocks, so the fort was considered practically impregnable by invading armies. The splendid historical fort with the awe-inspiring rock and the aesthetically fortified courts which have stood the ravages of time stir the imagination of tourists. A moat that encircles the fort, a vast underground chamber, trap doors, an armoury, stables, ponds, wells etc., make for fascinating viewing. The view from the top of the surrounding countryside is simply breathtaking. The Bala Hisar or citadel on the top of the hill gives a bird's eye view of the neighbouring area. The fort is associated with the rule of the heroic queen Rudramadevi and her grandson Prataparudra. "

The tone is set : even the Beijing Olympics ceremony cant compete with the mass games organized by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). The show is held several times a week and welcomes tourists from all over the World, including the US, in one of the most isolated and despised country on earth. The well-called  mass games  are designed to emphasize group dynamics rather than individual performances as the supreme emblem of communism. Prepared by hundred of thousands performers all along the year, after their classes for the youngest of them, they are entirely dedicated to the NKs leader Kim Jong Il and his deceased father Kim Il Sung, considered as the  Eternal president  and  sun of the 21st century      In the surroundings of Pyongyang's May Day giant Stadium, two girls are running to perform for the Arirang show. They are already dressed in their gymnastic outfits, as well as some 100,000 others who participate to the performance. They all come to honour their self-proclaimed  dear leader  Kim Jong Il, after a very hard and gruelling training, since their earliest age. Yet, it has been many years that Kim Jong Il has not shown up, formally for business reasons. But officials now admit the western medias assertions of illness. Anyways, Kim Jong Il or not, the mass games are held every year in Pyongyang, as a means for the regime to show to the entire world the countrys strength and good shape. To reach this sole purpose, not less than 100,000 people are involved in a choreographed show of simultaneous dancing and gymnastics. Many symbols are displayed by thousands of trained athlets, whether they are adults or even children. Hand over their heart, the young pupils sing in chorus ""We are the happiest children in the world"", one of the famous propaganda songs in North Korea. Many dancers make movements either with ribbons or colourful flowers named  kimjonglias  after the leader Kim Jong Il. All along the show, a live band plays a ceremonious music.   On the background, some 20,000 young koreans sit on the terraces, facing the spectators. They flip coloured cards at a high speed to form a fresco of animated and detailed images, changing from one to another. Each time they turn the page to create a new giant picture, they cry out. It creates a awe-inspiring atmosphere, as the shout is mixed with the noise of thousands of pages turned at the same moment. The figures are stunning : to compose these images, 2000 children  are needed to make only one soldier, 20,000 for a north korean flag. Hiding a much more grim reality, the panels represent Pyongyang enlightened by night, wheat fields ready for harvest, scientists at work, atoms as symbols of the nuclear bomb and others for the reunification of two Koreas. One of the North Koreas myths (history according to them) is recounted by the means of a huge image made by thousands of children. It represents the two pistols reportedly used by Kim Il Sung, when he founded the Anti-Japanese Peoples Guerrilla Army in 1932. When the pistols appear, the audience applauses loudly. Among them, many soldiers attend the show as the ultimate award after years of good and faithful service.The thousands and thousands of boys and girls involved create a giant mass movement in the stadium which leaves the public stunned. These talented performers are used to that kind of performance: in North Korea they have to dance, sing, jump and spin around as many times as there are celebrations, always in praise of their leaders. There are mainly two sorts of shows. The first one is the classical artistic show, named ""Arirang"" after the famous korean folk song (whose story sometimes changes, but most often  recounts the legend of a disappointed woman who hopes that her lover will return to her metaphor of the break-up with South Korea). The second one is a more political show, which was untitled in 2008 ""Prosper our country"" and intended to show the countrys greatest achievements and its struggle against the foreign oppressors.  The show continues in the same way for one hour. Thereafter, the thousands of people present vanish in the dark and silent streets of Pyongyang, which contrast with the flood of lights and music in the stadium. Within the space of a few hours, it gives us a a strange feeling, between the real and unreal, of another universe both terrifying and fantastic.    Dans toute la ville, les publicits dArirang ( Grande reprsentation gymnastique et artistique de masse ,  Bienvenue  Pyongyang  etc.) mettent le profane en garde Entre aot et octobre, a lieu lune des plus grandes et impressionnantes reprsentations au monde. Le ton est donn : pas mme la crmonie des Jeux de Pkin ne peut rivaliser avec les mass games organiss par la Rpublique Dmocratique Populaire de Core (RDPC). Le spectacle se tient plusieurs fois par semaine et accueille des touristes du monde entier, y compris des Etats-Unis, dans lun des pays les plus isols et mpriss sur terre. Les biens nomms mass games ( mouvements de masse) sont conus pour mettre en avant les dynamiques de groupe plutt que les performances individuelles comme emblme suprme du communisme. Prpars par des centaines de milliers dartistes tout au long de lanne, aprs les cours pour les plus jeunes dentre eux, les jeux sont entirement ddis au leader de la Core du Nord, Kim Jong Il, et feu son pre Kim Il Sung, considr comme l  Eternel prsident  et  soleil du 21me sicle   Aux environs du Stade gant May Day de Pyongyang, deux filles courent pour participer au spectacle de Arirang. Elles sont dj en costume de gymnastique, tout comme quelque 100 000 autres qui participent  la reprsentation. Tous viennent pour honorer leur autoproclam  cher leader  Kim Jong Il, aprs un trs difficile et prouvant entranement, depuis leur plus jeune ge. Pourtant, cela fait plusieurs annes que Kim Jong Il ne sest pas montr, formellement pour des raisons professionnelles. Mais des officiels admettent les assertions des mdias occidentaux sur sa maladie. Quoi quil en soit, Kim Jong Il ou pas, les jeux de masse ont lieu chaque anne  Pyongyang, comme moyen pour le rgime de montrer au monde entier la puissance et bonne sant du pays. Pour atteindre ce seul but, pas moins de 100 000 personnes sont engages dans une chorgraphie de danses et gymnastiques synchronises. De nombreux symboles sont affichs par des milliers dathltes entrans, quil sagisse dadultes ou mme denfants. Main sur le cur, les jeunes lves chantent en chur  Nous sommes les enfants les plus heureux du monde , lune des chansons de propagande les plus connues en Core du Nord. De nombreux danseurs font des mouvements avec des rubans ou avec des fleurs colores appeles  kimjonglias , du nom du leader Kim Jong Il. Tout le long du spectacle, un orchestre joue une musique solennelle.   larrire-plan, quelque 20 000 jeunes corens sont assis sur les gradins, faisant face aux spectateurs. Ils retournent des cartes colores  une grande vitesse pour former une fresque dimages animes et dtailles, changeant de lune  lautre. Chaque fois quils tournent la page pour crer une nouvelle illustration, ils crient. Cela cre une atmosphre impressionnante, le cri tant ml avec le bruit de milliers de pages tournes au mme moment. Les chiffres sont stupfiants : pour composer ces images, 2000 enfants sont ncessaires pour faire un seul soldat, 20 000 pour un drapeau de la Core du Nord. Cachant une ralit bien plus dure, les panneaux reprsentent Pyongyang claire la nuit, des champs de bl prt  tre rcolt, des scientifiques au travail, des atomes comme symboles de la bombe nuclaire et dautres pour la runification des deux Cores. Lun des mythes de Core du Nord (ou histoire selon eux) est relat au moyen dune image gigantesque faite par des milliers denfants. Elle reprsente les deux pistolets que Kim Il Sung aurait utiliss quand il a fond larme de gurilla populaire anti-japonaise en 1932. Lorsque les deux pistolets apparaissent, le public applaudit bruyamment. Parmi eux, de nombreux soldats assistent au spectacle comme rcompense ultime aprs des annes de bons et loyaux services. Les milliers et milliers de garons et de filles participant crent un mouvement de masse gant dans le stade, qui laisse le public bahi. Ces artistes talentueux sont coutumiers de ce type de reprsentation : en Core du Nord ils doivent danser, chanter, sauter et virevolter autant de fois quil y a de clbrations, toujours  la gloire de leurs chefs. Il existe principalement deux sortes de spectacles. Le premier est le spectacle classique artistique, appel  Arirang  daprs la clbre chanson folklorique corenne (dont lhistoire quelques fois change, mais qui raconte le plus souvent la lgende dune femme due qui espre que son amant lui reviendra mtaphore de la sparation avec la Core du Sud). Le second est un spectacle plus politique, qui tait intitul en 2008  Que prospre notre pays  et qui tentait de montrer les plus grandes ralisations du pays et sa lutte contre les oppresseurs trangers.   Le spectacle continue de cette faon pendant une heure. Ensuite, les milliers de personnes prsentes disparaissent dans les rues sombres et silencieuses de Pyongyang, ce qui contraste avec le dluge de lumires et de musique dans le stade. En lespace de quelques heures, cela nous donne un trange sentiment, entre le rel et lirrel, dun autre univers  la fois terrifiant et fantastique.    Eric Lafforgue www.ericlafforgue.com "

This magnificent racing dhow and crew are in the lead as they move into the final leg of the race. They are the ultimate winners from the island of Pate at the northern end of the archipelago near the border with Somali.  Six crewmen are perched on an adjustable dhow plank that hangs out over the water for added balance, speed and stability.  About sixteen young men all together are crowded into each of these hand-crafted dhows to give the necessary weight, balance and stability against a stiff coastal trade wind - a classic trade wind that has historically characterized this region since Lamu was first established in the 14th Century as a major Swahili trading outpost and settlement on the coastal run between Zanzibar and the Arabic world to the north.   The art of dhow sailing requires considerable team skill as the dhows tack and manoeuvre back and forth through the Manda channel and ultimately out to the edge of the open sea. The finest dhows are usually selected from each village to compete and race under sail through a complicated series of buoys, combining speed and balance with elaborate tacking and maneuvering competence.   The winners in this dhow will return to their home on the island of Pate with team bragging rights and a certain village swagger that may last several months until the next race. Intense team and village rivalries build over the years, often reaching pitch fever on race day.   The races are usually organized in conjunction with a cultural festival or an Islamic religious holiday celebrating the birth of Abraham or the prophet Mohammed. These fine Mashua racing dhows are in the final leg of the classic Shela-based race organized by Peponi's on New Year's Day.   Swahili Dhow Culture On Flickriver"

This is the view of Pigeon Spire's west ridge from the Pigeon-Howser Col with Bugaboo Spire on the left beyond the glacier.  The Bugaboos - August 12-18, 2012  Living in Squamish I am very lucky to be surrounded by excellent rock to train my technical climbing skills as well as many great peaks for scrambling. But, until last week I had never had the opportunity to combine the two skills I've been developing for years. That all changed when a friend invited me to be her partner on the yearly trip my friend group takes. Two months after the invitiation, a partner swap, and a week of careful packing and preparation I actually found myself driving east about to embark on what would be the greatest adventure of my life to date.  The moment I arrived at basecamp my lofty climbing aspiration were downgraded to starting with a 4th class route and going from there. I received tons of advice from friends that had been going for several years, but still nothing could have prepared me for the reality of being there. The ascent to Applebee basecamp, the scale of the spires, the difficulty of the glaciers, and the exposure did not translate well to maps and photos I found myself in awe and terror. Every single obstacle I encountered was more physically and mentally demanding that I could have expected.  Even though we were with a large group of friends, we were on our own when we headed out for the day and often learning as we went. As a result we learned many lessons the hard way, including when to put crampons on, when to switch into rock shoes, how hard preventing rockfall can be, and all the ways rappelling can go wrong.  It was both the single most terrifying and rewarding experience of my life. Never did I expect to learn so much in a week, or do so little actual climbing. Instead it was a wild ride of alpine obstacles, and a truly life changing experience shared with great friends old and new.  A brief summary of my adventure:  Aug 12 - Hike into Applebee base camp with 80+lbs pack full of climbing, camping, and glacier gear as well as 7 days of food, and clothes for everything from -10 to +30 degrees celcius rain and shine. Aug 13 - Eastpost spire, combination of Northeast and Northwest ridges. Aug 14 - Crescent Spire, W ridge. - Rained off first attempt, after self arresting and improv. anchor construction. Aug 15 - Crescent Spire, W ridge - Successful ascent followed by rappelling disaster involving ditching a rope that was later recovered Aug 16 - Pigeon Spire, W ridge - Got 30m up route then turned back to save terror management skills for descent back down the Bugaboo-Snowpatch col Aug 17 - Eastpost spire again and bathing in the tarn Aug 18 - Hike out and long drive home  Please feel free to contact me with any questions regarding my experience.  Photos from this trip were taken with a combination of my Nikon D7000, Olympus uT8000 & GoPro HD2"

I'm just thankful it's possible.   sometimes I feel like You live out there. in the woods behind my house, in the nature that always fills me with awe. I feel like that's where I get closest to Your presence. like those deer ,that were right next to me as I took this, were a little gift from You. like the sun that came out was supossed to get me out of the bed when I slept throught the day. like the forest is the only place I can find You at sometimes. I wish I was able to see You in the ordinary. I'm sorry that most of the time I'm not. I so desperately wish to see my worth in You.  so even when I don't understand, I choose to love You above all else.

I love to find beautiful scenes just as they are, without adding filters, retouching, manipulation and using only available light. I think of my camera and my lenses like a painter thinks of a brush and paint: theyre the tools I use to show the world as I see it.  Im never happier than when I have my camera with me and Im shooting. Then I forget my backs broken (yes, I can walk), that some things worry me, that things arent as theyre supposed to. When Im taking photographs, life is perfect, joyful, Im in awe of the things I find, and Im always moved by life and beauty on this planet. I tend to use my macro lens a lot its my favourite, but well, on a trip I jump from the macro to the zoom. My cameras have always been Nikon, and these were taken with a D80. These photos were taken on my second trip to India, almost 20 years after the first one, and some of these photographs will be part of an exhibit soon. Their names and info, plus many more photos are on my site. Youre welcome to visit it. Which are your favourites?  To know more about this photo and see more like it, visit www.arysnyder.com or www.blog.arysnyder.com  Me defino como cazadora de imgenes. Me encanta encontrar momentos hermosos tal y como son, sin interferir en ellos, sin usar filtros, retoques, manipulacin y usando slo la luz disponible. Mi cmara y mis lentes son lo que un pincel y pintura para un pintor: son herramientas que uso para mostrar lo que veo, mi visin del mundo. Nunca soy ms feliz que cuando estoy tomando fotos. Entonces me olvido que me romp la espalda (s, puedo caminar), que hay cosas que me preocupan, que algunas cosas no son como debieran. Cuando tomo fotos, la vida es perfecta, y todo me sorprende hasta conmoverme. Tendo a usar mucho mi macro es mi lente favorito, pero en un viaje siempre voy del macro al zoom y cambio mucho de lentes. Siempre he tenido cmaras Nikon, y estas fotos fueron tomadas con una D80. Estas fotos fueron tomadas en mi segundo viaje a India, casi 20 aos despus del primero, y algunas de estas imgenes sern parte de una exhibicin muy pronto.
