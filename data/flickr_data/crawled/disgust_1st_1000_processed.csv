Found in Tasmania and as far north as south-east Queensland, it has the distinction of being the first fungus from Australia to be scientifically described. It was named, no doubt after he smelled it, by botanist Jacques Labillardiere at Recherche Bay, Tasmania, in 1792.  The fungus appears to do a good job of mimicking a wound on an animal - an interesting piece of evolution, if true. It looks a bit like a fly trap, but it doesn't catch or eat flies. Instead, it uses them to spread its spores. For food it uses wood in the mulch or forest litter that it inhabits.  The fruiting body in the photo shows the smelly black spore slime that acts as a fly attractant. I find its odour more like that of rotting teeth than rotting flesh, a concentrated essence de caries.  The fruiting body only lasts a few days but rewards quiet observation. Our Aseroe specimens attract the rather beautiful, though agriculturally troublesome, green blowfly.  Kevin Maher, Witta, Queensland, Australia By Blogger Michael Marshall on October 29, 2008 4:36 PM Curiously, this fungus has leapt several continents and established itself in the UK on Oxshott Heath in Surrey, where it has been appearing exotically for the last 10 years or more.  The fungal fruiting body doesn't catch flies any more than a ripe apple catches wasps. The flies (which tend to be mainly bluebottles in the UK) are attracted to the carrion smell of the slimy spore mass supported on the tentacle-like arms. The slime contains sugars and the flies ingest it, spores and all. These pass through the gut unharmed and are dispersed elsewhere. The fungus itself - visible as a white mycelium - lives on rotten, often buried, wood.  A related Australian species with longer tentacles, Clathrus archeri or the devil's fingers, has also become established in southern England and is now quite widespread, as is the European Clathrus ruber, or cage fungus, whose tentacles mesh to form a cage-like receptacle.  More common and more familiar is our native stinkhorn, which also lures flies to help spread its spores. The stinkhorn forms fruiting bodies as obvious as the plant's Latin name, Phallus impudicus, suggests. It is said that Charles Darwin's daughter Etty used to rise early to destroy any that she found, in order to ensure that the morals of her maids were not corrupted.

My mom and I went to an apple orchard and pumpkin patch today, but so did half of New York City. Every Sunday in October, people from the city come down to New Jersey and Pennsylvania for the ""country"" experience. That's why every weekend in October is ""Apple Weekend!"" at every orchard near my house. The city dwellers watch leaves fall and go to orchards and pumpkin patches. It's quite entertaining to watch them. You can tell which people are from the city because they totter around the pumpkin patch in high heels and are overly dressed for the muddy fields. Also, I never knew falling leaves could be so fascinating, but they will sit and watch them for hours. Who knows what they see."

Wherever you go, there is someone grilling delicious lamb skewers or preparing pilaf. Most of these street stalls and restaurants have the animals carcasses hanging in the open air. I discovered that the uyghurs also like to eat the lambs heads.  And yes, it's kind of disgusting, especially if you're a vegan, a vegetarian or if you just simply don't eat meat (or you do, but you don't want to know where it really ""comes"" from). On the other hand, I really just realized on this trip that it's an unavoidable matter; even if I've been to basically oases cities, and thus, its peoples have been settled for hundreds of years and practice agriculture, I can not forget the fact that, beyond these green spots on this area, there is a humongous number of people that can just not simply rely on a piece of land to grow vegetables. There are even, still, nomadic minorities that can only depend on their herds of lambs, goats, yaks and camels to survive. In fact, I was really happy to see that, at least, and since these animals ""have"" to be slaughtered to provide some of us food, every little and single part of them are consumed... (And be warned... There might be sequels...) I've never seen, however, ""factories"" of lambs and ""aviaries"" of goats. What I saw were herders walking their animals on the street, trying to sell them directly to the restaurants owners...  Once again, I was astonished by the way, indeed, every little drop or crumb or hair is used, and by the fact that so many things are still so this ""back to the origins"" and handmade as it might have been when the real Silk Road still existed...

To a lot of people earwigs tend to provoke disgust or a feeling of unease. However this is less due to the mythology that they crawl into the ears and chew into the brain and more to do with the fact that they are typically found in places which we are inherently uncomfortable around; that is to say compost heaps, under wood or bricks and other warm and humid places. Their scuttling behaviour, and menacing pincers hardly endear them any further. Despite people's aversion, they are rather innocuous insects with only some causing damage to crops or flowers.  Earwigs display strong photophobic tendencies, retreating back into the darkness when exposed to  light. Consequently they are predominantly nocturnal, their morphology supports this lifestyle, flattened, muscular bodies enabling them to wedge into cracks and crevices. However, they leave behind the safety of shelter when dusk descends whereupon they begin foraging. Diet is largely omnivorous, however some species may be more inclined towards either carnivory or herbivory. In the former case, the long cerci (pincers) are used to catch and kill their prey.  Earwigs typically live one year during which time they undergo ~5 moults. Their sexual identity becomes apparent towards the second moult when the shape of the cerci can be used as a sexual determinant: curved cerci for males and straight ones for females. Nevertheless some species may show other dimorphisms. As previously mentioned the cerci function to catch prey, but they can also be used for defense, assuming a curled up posture when feeling threatened. A more benign purpose though is to help fold their wings under the elytra/tegmina and for use in mating rituals.  Perhaps the caring parental habits of females will help to assuage people's discomfort around dermapterans. Females lay between 20-80 eggs and vigorously defend them until they hatch. During this period females clean the eggs assiduously to prevent fungal colonization of her brood. When the young do hatch the female feeds her young by regurgitating food for them and continues providing care until around the second instar stage when the young are capable of fending for themselves. Though survival is far from assured, as young earwigs have to contend with many predators, ranging from Amphibians and reptiles to Arachnids and parasitic tachinid flies."
