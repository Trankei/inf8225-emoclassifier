Air strikes in Gaza has caused further destruction and misery for Palestinians who face crippling poverty and hardship on a daily basis.  According to Al-Jazeera website, at least 700 Palestinians have been injured since the start of the Israeli attacks as quoted by the Palestinian Health Ministry.  Hundreds of homes destroyed, infrastructure and communication lines are damaged and hospitals are overcrowded and fast running out of supplies whilst you read this, casualty list increasing rapidly. The current attack on Gaza has caused more damaged in two days than it did during an eight-day campaign in 2012.  The people of Gaza are already suffering from years of Israeli aggression with the previous operation Cast Lead killed 1,417 Palestinians.  This current crisis is in response to the kidnapping and killing of three Israeli teenagers whose bodies were found outside Gaza and the Israel Government put the blame squarely on Hamas but as yet their is no proof of their involvement.  But the deaths of three Israeli teenagers does not warrant the subsequent heavy military response that is typical of Israel and the IDF. Nowhere in the rest of the world does a government send out a full infantry with tanks and military jets when children are killed  this is beyond any reasonable doubt ethnic cleansing and the rest of the world governments need to stop the genocide of the Palestinians, open the Rafa borders and allow humanitarian aid which has also been blockaded for so many years.      The people of Gaza live in conditions worse than animals in the zoo  they are humans and they are our brothers and sisters. We dont want you to simply make donations  yes right now these people need humanitarian assistance, but apart from donations we need to raise awareness, boycott Israeli goods and send a message to your community leaders and MPs that enough is enough. The blood of our arab brothers and sisters is not cheap  the fear that we see in the eyes of the Palestinians each time mega tonne bombs hit and destroy homes and kill and maim hundreds and thousands year in year out has to stop and we are the majority that needs to pull ourselves together and fight the cause for our Palestinian brothers and sisters so it becomes an independent state!  Please help us to help the people of Gaza!!!  We urgently need to send emergency aid in the form of survival packs containing food, blankets and hygiene kits as well as life saving medical supplies and most of all hospital beds as their are simply insufficient beds in the surrounding hospitals in Gaza otherwise patients with life-threatening injuries have to rest on hospital corridors. Israel has promised to continue this violent an aggressive onslaught so the the situation is only going to get worst for residents who continue to observe the long hours fast for Ramadan."

The construction workers are burning paper (fake) money to appease the hungry ghosts.  The Hungry Ghost Month is held in August or September, depending on the lunar calendar with the highlight being the Hungry Ghost Festival.  A lot more attention is paid the Hungry Ghost Month in Singapore and Malaysia than in Hong Kong.  Wing Tai Asia is a property development company in Singapore, Malaysia, China and Hong Kong with its head office in Singapore.  Most of the construction workers taking part in the ritual are Bangladeshi or Indian.  During this month, it is believed the king of hell opens the gates of hell to allow ghosts to visit the living world. It is the only time of year that ghosts are released to freely roam the Earth.  The hungry ghosts, also called good brethren, are believed to be ancestors of people who were not given a proper funeral or burial. People also give sacrifices to anonymous ghosts to keep them away and from harming them.  Ghost Month festivities begin at midnight on the first day of the seventh month of the lunar year when the gates of hell are open. Many temples across China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan hold ceremonies which include incense burning, food offerings, prayers and lantern lighting. Red lanterns bearing the names of the deceased are switched on and remain on for the duration of the festival.  Daily rituals during the Hungry Ghost Month include people offering sacrifices to the ghosts so the hungry ghosts will not harm them. The sacrifices include rice, meat and fruit. Red candles, joss sticks, incense, and paper money are burned daily until the end of the month when it is believed the ghosts return to hell. Miniature paper items like cars, houses, and clothes are also burned as the living want to ensure the deceased have all the material goods they need for the coming year.  Some families eat vegetarian meals and set an extra place settings for each deceased family members.  In the middle of the Hungry Ghost month is the Hungry Ghost Festival. Paper lanterns are placed on the water and burned on this evening. It is believed the gates of hell are the most open on this night. Many believers refrain from going out after the dark for fear they may encounter a ghost.  The ghosts return to the underworld and the gates of hell are closed on the last night of Hungry Ghost Month. "

This formerly common bee has disappeared from 87 percent of its range in the Upper Midwest and Eastern Seaboard and is feared headed for extinction.  The research team, led by Bill McShea and Tom Akre of the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute and Tai Roulston from the University of Virginia, surveyed bee populations at 17 Virginia sites from May through August to study the influence of land management on bee diversity. Only one individual of this now rare species was found among nearly 35,000 bees belonging to 126 species collected and examined by the study. The study is part of Virginia Working Landscapes, a collaborative research program aimed at discovering effective ways private landholders can practice biodiversity management.

And insane amount of photos to follow over the next few weeks. Stay tuned!  Some History of the place:  ""Pennhurst was constructed and opened in 1908 as a state school for the mentally and physically disabled. Pennhurst's property was vast, covering 120 acres. Created to house over 10,000 patients at a point in time, Pennhurst was one of the largest institutions of its kind in Pennsylvania. Half of Pennhurst's residents were committed by court order and the other half were brought by a parent or other guardian. It was devoted strictly to the care, treatment and education of the disabled. Originally named Pennhurst Home for the Feeble Minded and Epileptic, it finally was just called Pennhurst State School. Pennhurst employed a large number of staff to help assist in maintaining the facility. This staff included a board of trustees, medical staff, dental staff, and specialists in psychology, social services, accounting, and various fields of education. The grounds of Pennhurst included a 300-bed hospital, which had a full nursing staff and two surgeons on call at all times. Others at Pennhurst included members of the clergy and farming experts who grew most of Pennhurst's food . Pennhurst was an essentially self-sufficient community, its 1,400-acre site containing a firehouse, general store, barber shop, movie theatre, auditorium and even a greenhouse. The buildings of Pennhurst were named after towns in Pennsylvania such as Chester and Devon. The original buildings were designed by architect Phillip H. Johnson. All of Pennhurst's electricity was generated by an on-site power plant. A cemetery lay on the property, as well as baseball and recreational fields for the residents. Many of Pennhurst's buildings were strictly for storage; however, the majority were dormitory and hospital-style living quarters for the residents. Many of the buildings had security screens that were accessed on the inside, to prevent patients from escaping, or jumping to their deaths. Most of the stairwells had security fences to keep patients from jumping over the railings. Many of the buildings are linked by an underground tunnel system designed for transportation of handicapped patients to and from the dormitory, recreational buildings and dietary.  Pennhurst was often accused of dehuminazitation and was said to have provided no help to the mentally challenged. The institution had a long history of staff difficulties and negative public image, for example, a 1968 report by NBC called ""Suffer the Little Children"". Pennhurst State School was closed in 1986 following several allegations of abuse. These allegations led to the first lawsuit of its kind in the United States, Pennhurst State School and Hospital vs. Halderman, which asserted that the mentally retarded have a constitutional right to living quarters and an education. Terry Lee Halderman had been a resident of the school, and upon release she filed suit in the district court on behalf of herself and all other residents of Pennhurst. The complaint alleged that conditions at Pennhurst were unsanitary, inhumane and dangerous, that these living conditions violated the fourteenth amendment, and that Pennhurst used cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth and fourteenth amendments. After a 32-day trial and an immense investigation, prosecutors concluded that the conditions at Pennhurst were not only dangerous, with physical and mental abuse of its patients, but also inadequate for the care and habilitation for the mentally retarded. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania also concluded that the physical, mental, and intellectual skills of most patients had deteriorated while in Pennhurst.  In 1986, Pennhurst was ordered closed, and began a program of de-institutionalism that lasted several years. Once the buildings were closed, they began to rapidly deteriorate from lack of heating, moisture invasion and vandalism. Thousands of people began to illegally tour the property spray painting everything in sight and breaking all the glass in the place. Theft was rampant and the destruction of the property was in full swing. Patients were thrown out and a large homeless contingent developed in the area.  Pennhurst fell into complete ruin as the complex was shut down. Buildings were abandoned as they were, with patients clothes and belonging strewn about. Furniture, cabinets and medical equipment were left to decay as if someone had just got up and walked out the front door. This is the place that will eventually resurrect into one of the most studied properties in the ghost hunter media, and will become an amazing haunted attraction.""

(2013)  www.amctv.com/shows/immortalized  =========================================== The Sea Rabbit (Monafluffchus americanus) of Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York  This unique sea-dwelling rabbit, which is actually a close relative of the sea lion, was officially discovered and investigated by Henry Hudson when he first visited this land to colonize the area by order of the Dutch government. It was named New Amsterdam -- todays New York City. This island was named after he saw the beach covered with strange swimming wild rabbits. The word Coney Island means wild rabbit island in Dutch (originally Conyne Eylandt, or Konijneneiland in modern Dutch spelling). Sea rabbits were also referred mermaid rabbit, merrabbit, rabbit fish or seal rabbit in the natural history documents in the 17th century. The current conservation status, or risk of extinction, of the sea rabbit is Extinct in the Wild.   This website features two species of sea rabbits, which have been taken care of by Dr. Takeshi Yamada () at the Coney Island Sea Rabbit Repopulation Center, which is a part of the Marine biology department of the Coney Island University in Brooklyn, New York. They are  Coney Island Sea Rabbit (Monafluffchus americanus) called Seara and Coney Island Tiger-striped Sea Rabbit (Monafluffchus konjinicus) called Stripes.   The photographs and videos featured in this website chronicle adventures of the Coney Island sea rabbits and the world as seen by them. This article also documented efforts of Dr. Takeshi Yamada for bringing back the nearly extinct sea rabbits to Coney Island in the City of New York and beyond. Dr. Yamada produced a series of public lectures, workshops, original public live interactive fine art performances and fine art exhibitions about sea rabbits at a variety of occasions and institutions in the City of New York and beyond. Dr. Yamada is an internationally active educator, book author, wildlife conservationist and high profile artist, who lives and works in Brooklyn, New York.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sea Rabbit  Other Common Names: Coney Island Sea Rabbit, Beach Rabbit, Seal Rabbit, mer-rabbit, merrabbit, Atlantic Sea Rabbit.  Latin Name: Monafluffchus americanus  Origin: Atlantic coast of the United States  Description of the specimen: In the early 17th centurys European fur craze drove the fleet of Dutch ships to the eastern costal area of America. Then Holland was the center of the world just like the Italy was in the previous century. New York City was once called New Amsterdam when Dutch merchants landed and established colonies. Among them, Henry Hudson is probably the most recognized individual in the history of New York City today. This small island is inhabited by two major creatures which we do not have in our homeland. The one creature is a large arthropod made of three body segments: the frontal segment resembles a horseshoe, the middle segment resembles a spiny crab and its tail resembles a sharp sword. Although they gather beaches here in great numbers, they are not edible due to their extremely offensive odor. Another creature which is abundant here, has the head of wild rabbit. This animal of great swimming ability has frontal legs resemble the webbed feet of a duck. The bottom half of the body resembles that of a seal. This docile rabbit of the sea is easy to catch as it does not fear people. The larger male sea rabbits control harems of 20 to 25 females. The meat of the sea rabbit is very tender and tasty. This is what Hadson wrote in his personal journal in 1609 about the horseshoe crab and the sea rabbit in todays Coney Island area of Brooklyn, New York. Sadly, just like the Dodo bird and the Thylacine, the sea rabbit was driven to extinction by the European settlers greed. When Dutch merchants and traders arrived here, sea rabbits were one of the first animals they hunted down to bring their furs to homeland to satisfy the fur craze of the time. To increase the shipment volume of furs of sea rabbit and beavers from New Amsterdam, Dutch merchants also started using wampum (beads made of special clam shells) as the first official currency of this country.   At the North Eastern shores of the United States, two species of sea rabbits were commonly found. They are Coney Island Sea Rabbit (Monafluffchus americanus) and Coney Island Tiger-striped Sea Rabbit (Monafluffchus konjinicus). Sadly, due to their over harvesting in the previous centuries, their conservation status became Extinct in the Wild (ET) in the Red List Endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Currently, these sea rabbits are only found at breeding centers at selected zoos and universities such as Coney Island Aquarium and Coney Island University in Brooklyn, New York. The one shown in this photograph was named ""Seara"" and has been cared by Dr. Takeshi Yamada at Coney Island University.   The sea rabbit is one of the families of the Pinniped order. Pinnipeds (from Latin penna = flat and pes/pedis = foot) are sea-mammals: they are homeothermic (i.e having high and regulated inner temperature), lung-breathing (i.e dependant on atmospheric oxygen) animals having come back to semi aquatic life. As soon as they arrive ashore, females are caught by the nearest adult male. Males can maintain harems of about 20 females on average. Several hours to several days after arriving ashore, pregnant females give birth to eight to ten pups with a dark brown fur. As soon as birth occurs, the mothers special smell and calls help her pups bond specifically to her. The mother stays ashore with her pup for about one week during which the pup gains weight. During the first week spent with her newborn, the mother becomes receptive. She will be impregnated by the bull, which control the harem. Implantation of the embryo will occur 3 months later, in March-April. During the reproductive period, the best males copulate with several tens females. To do so, males have to stay ashore without feeding in order to keep their territory and their harem. In mid-January, when the last females have been fecundated, males leave at sea to feed. Some of them will come back later in March-April for the moult. The other ones will stay at sea and will come back on Coney Island only in next November. After fecundation, the mother goes at sea for her first meal. At sea, mothers feed on clams, crabs, shrimps, fish (herring, anchovy, Pollock, capelin etc.) and squids. When she is back, the mother recovers her pups at the beach she left them. Suckling occurs after auditive and olfactory recognition had occured. In March-April, the dark brown fur is totally replaced by an adult-like light brownish grey fur during the moult that lasts 1-2 months. This new fur is composed by 2 layers. Externally, the guard fur is composed by flat hairs that recover themselves when wet. By doing so, they make a water-proof barrier for the under fur. The underfur retains air when the seal is dry. Because of isolating properties of the air, the underfur is the insulating system of the fur. In March-April, the fur of adults is partially replaced. First reproduction occurs at 1-yr old in females. Males are physiologically matures at 1 year old but socially matures at +2 years old.    NOTE: The name of Coney Island is commonly thought to be derived from the Dutch Konijn Eylandt or Rabbit Island as apparently the 17th century European settlers noted many rabbits running amuck on the island.   =========================================== Reference: Dr. Takeshi Yamada was an Immortalizer on Immortalized, the AMC cable televisions new original unscripted television series about competitive taxidermy.
