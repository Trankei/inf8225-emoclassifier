As Strange as it sounds, I actually like to get smashed into the ground and taken over the falls.  It add to the sense of exile ration and excitement. It keeps your heart rate pumping.  This instance was a little different.    I was scared, put simply.  Being in the water was the simple bit once you understood you had to dodge the large sneaker sets which would detonate right next to your head if you were unlucky, spinning and slamming you into the hard slab of rock about a foot or 2 below the surface.  The fun bit was the entering and exiting the water.  A very nice rip would drag you off the shallow slab and into a channel which consequently led to a large nasty close-out section.  Timing and positioning were everything.   But hey, its all part of the fun and I wouldn't change it ever.

It was a free afternoon for elementary-aged school children and their families to look at how NASA explores space and studies Earth from space using satellites and other technology.  This months Sunday Experiment explored NASAs Tracking and Data Relay Satellite project. The TDRS project at NASA Goddard is building three new Tracking and Data Relay Satellites: TDRS K, L and M. Nine TDRS spacecraft are currently in geosynchronous orbit. Together they form the space-based communication relay network known as the Space Network (SN).  The SN is made up of seven TDRS spacecraft that are responsible for relaying more than 40 different spacecrafts' data to the ground 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The TDRS constellation is responsible for gathering data from low-Earth orbiting spacecraft such as the Hubble Space Telescope, NASA's Earth-observing fleet of satellites and the International Space Station, and transmitting it to TDRS ground terminals. Once the data arrives at the ground terminals, it is sent out to the spacecrafts data processing facilities across the country. The communication also works the opposite direction with controllers on the ground using the SN to send commands like Hey, satellite, turn your camera on! to spacecraft.   TDRS K is the first of the third generation of TDRS satellites and is scheduled for launch in January 2013. This generation of TDRS will ensure that NASAs communication needs are met for many years to come.  In addition to celebrating all things science, technology, engineering and mathematics, the Sunday Experiment celebrates major science missions that are managed by NASA Goddard and set to launch in the near future. The Sunday Experiment is a place where children and adults alike can discover the excitement of Goddard through fun and engaging activities.  Sunday Experiment, held the third Sunday of each month, spotlights Goddard's world-renowned science and engineering research, and technological developments. Families leave inspired by the activities, wowed by the scientists and engineers, and excited about Goddard's revolutionary research and technology.

In this superlative mystery comedy statuettes of little soldier boys on the mantel of a house on an island off the coast of Devon fall to the floor and break one by one as those in the house succumb to a diabolical avenger. A nursery rhyme tells how each of the ten soldiers met his death until there were none. Eight guests who have never met each other on their apparently absent host and hostess are lured to the island, along with the two house servants, marooned.   A mysterious voice accuses each of having gotten away with murder and then one drops dead  poisoned. One down and nine to go! The excitement never lets up and the search for the murderer never ceases which keeps the audience at the edge of their seat.

I spent NYE on Granville St in Vancouver BC with two other fantastic photographers capturing the fun of the evening. We lined up side-by-side, many people thought we were with a newspaper or that we knew something really amazing was just about to take place and they asked what it was and wanted to watch too. I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over. I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol. I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.   Some of the photos might seem a bit strange with the movement/blur but I find them artistic and you can find some interesting pictures within a photo when you let yourself just look without expectations. You may also notice the odd clear face/s that paused in all the movement & excitement. All in all, everyone was having a fantastic time!!

There was personal redemption, too, for Carli Lloyd, who answered her missed kick in that 3-1 shootout loss by scoring a goal in each half to seal the Olympic crown for her nation.  Japan were dubbed the Barcelona of the women's game for their flurry of neat passing and slick movement and their average height of 5ft 4in compared to the US's 5ft 7in. The Americans were the big tournament specialists. This was the fifth women's Olympic final and USA were continuing their record of being in all of them, losing only to Norway at Sydney 2000, 3-2.  For Japan, their coach Norio Sasaki framed the attempted conquest of gold as part of the country's healing process, following the trauma of last year's earthquake which killed nearly 20,000 people.  Ahead of this final he said: ""All the Japanese people are still trying to come back from the earthquake disaster.  ""Winning the World Cup was very emotional last year and gave energy to the nation after what had happened and the same can happen again.""  After eight minutes a noisy, though not completely filled Wembley, witnessed the opening strike. Tobin Heath galloped into space down the left before Alex Morgan's twist and cross was met by Carli Lloyd, just ahead of the 143-goal Abby Wambach.  Far from being unsettled, Japan went in search of an instant reply. A shot from Nahomi Kawasumi was blocked by the USA captain, Christie Rampone, with Hope Solo, the keeper, stranded. Yuki Ogimi followed up but could not convert.  Ogimi went closer moments later. A hanging jump was followed by the forward's header being superbly palmed onto the bar b y Solo.  The goal-frame proved an extra defender for both sides. Amy LePeilbet's cross was met with a glancing header by Rampone that hit Yuki Fukomoto's right post. At the opposite end, Aya Miyama's pile-driver smashed back off the bar.  Ogimi was instrumental in every Japan attack. Her lay-off nine minutes from half-time was hit with a menacing curl by Shinobu Ohno but the ball was marginally wide of the post.  The open, entertaining nature of this contest continued after the break. Japan spread the ball across midfield only for their attacks to founder due to a belief deficit. When given sight of goal  as Miyama, the captain, on 52 minutes  the opportunity was snatched at.  When America flooded forward there was menace. After Megan Rapinoe laid the ball into Lloyd, she surged from near half-way then unloaded a 20-yard humdinger that gave the 5ft 4in keeper Fukumoto no chance, and that was 2-0 to Pia Sunhage's team.  In the 63nd minute Japan's Ogimi raised the excitement scale to fevered after her strike, though this proved a consolation as the neat triangles that were ending in cul-de-sacs continued to frustrate the Japanese.  The world champions still had their chances but when Miyama had two free-kicks to deliver in quick succession, her side failed to profit."

Keen air whips the blood to the facewith such a tingle, and the excitement of the pos-sibility of a spill and of the motion and the neces-sity for alertness of guiding is so great, that,purely as a sport, it has few equals. But, joyousas Fanny had always found skate-sailing, it wasnot sport to-night; it was business. She had littletime for enjoyment; every nerve was strained toget to town and get the doctor back to that poorburned body in the house, already far behind.Yet it was impossible to keep some feeling ofexultation from her heart, even though she chidedherself for it. Even as she exulted in the swift motion andshook with a little shiver of pleasure at herspeed, her face blanched. Seeming an answerto the loud ring of skates on brittle ice therecame through the air from behind a soft, high,keen note. She had never heard it, but she ! newwhat it was.

One wolf can be scared away, two orthree need but little vigilance, but a pack isdeath to one man, be he armed how he may. For a moment panic gripped her. But alwaysshe saw in her imagination the picture of asuffering, dearly loved face, a freckled handgroping for her. The young face steeled itself. It s for Jack. He d do it for me, shethought, and swung a little closer to the wind. The black ribbon of ice swung steady and lowbeneath her feet, and there was but little noise,only the hiss of the skates as they cut into thecold-cracked surface, and an occasional clangas she struck with one foot or another a frozenbit of wood, an air-hole, or a crack.

I spent NYE on Granville St in Vancouver BC with two other fantastic photographers capturing the fun of the evening. We lined up side-by-side, many people thought we were with a newspaper or that we knew something really amazing was just about to take place and they asked what it was and wanted to watch too. I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over. I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol. I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.   Some of the photos might seem a bit strange with the movement/blur but I find them artistic and you can find some interesting pictures within a photo when you let yourself just look without expectations. You may also notice the odd clear face/s that paused in all the movement & excitement. All in all, everyone was having a fantastic time!!  If you see yourself in any of the pictures on my Facebook page, please tag yourself and then share the photos to your friends & family. If you like my page then you will get notified for when I post the rest of the pictures which are coming soon! www.facebook.com/AnnaHallPhotographer  Thank YOU for posing for me and bringing such great energy to NYE!!"

The theme of the event was Definitely Dallas! due to Omnis dedication to make each of their hotels look authentic to its location. On Friday, the first full day of the excitement-packed weekend, meeting planners chose to visit Cowboys Stadium, Southfork Ranch with J.R. Ewing himself, the famous Larry Hagman, or Texas Motor Speedway. Later that evening, planners attended Dallas Double Take event put on by DCVB where planners were encouraged by Mayor Rawlings, Larry Hagman and DCVB President Phillip Jones to take a second look at Dallas and the incredible attractions the city has to offer. Saturday brought more activities to experience in the busy Dallas area. Meeting planners visited the Old American Golf course, beautiful Dallas Arboretum and the Sixth Floor Museum. Other planners opted for the Whats new in Dallas? tour where they saw the Perot Museum of Nature and Science, expected to open in 2013, and the new Margaret Hunt-Hill Bridge, designed by Spanish Architect Santiago Calatrava. That evening, planners dressed in their best and went to the Gala Dinner hosted by MSNBCs Contessa Brewer. Planners dined while special guest Tim Halperin from American Idol performed his gorgeous piano melodies. At the after party, planners enjoyed a performance by country king and SMU alum Jack Ingram. The weekends festivities concluded the following morning with a farewell Gospel Brunch to send them back to their hometowns. The Omni Hotel in the heart of Downtown Dallas did a wonderful job introducing the meeting planners to our Dallas. Congratulations to the Omni Dallas Hotel on such a successful Grand Opening weekend.

Landrake Moto Parc was founded in 1995 and is set in 25 acres of beautiful Cornish countryside, with the track taking approximately half of the site - the rest for paddock area and spectator parking. We also have another 10 acres for additional parking for the very large events. The track is 1900km long and is a minimum of 10 metres wide with some sections 15 metres wide and sits in a valley with trees on one side. With features such as a whoop section, raised berms, ski-ramps, step-downs and step-ups, and a laptime of over two minutes, exhilarating racing is ensured. 40 GP-standard start gates lead you to a 110 metre start straight, turning out into a wide downhill and then a chicane - followed by a very popular feature with spectators immediately in front of the pits - a table-top suitable for laying down some whips and scrubs, with a 100 foot tabletop right after! All this with superb viewing for specatators.   Whilst the track is fast and flowing, its a very technical track, with some old-school features such as adverse cambers and natural terrain, combined with some man-made jumps, along with a rythm section to add to the excitement for riders and spectators alike. So, riders need sublime skills to get a winning lap here.

In preparation for the long walk to Mamquam I met with my new partner for a scramble up Tricouni peak, just north of Squamish. Not only did we need to meet and plan our trip, but I was just getting over a bad lung infection and needed a solid day in the mountains to clear my body of its congestion. We met downtown much earlier than I tend to raise (still no alpine start), but I was pleased to discover he had brought along an acquaintance of mine who I was more than happy to spend a day getting to know. Full of excitement and passion for mountains we were off to enjoy a gray, overcast day of scrambling Tricouni peak.   In every report of Tricouni I ever read there were consistent reports of the trail being very muddy at the beginning. It was the end of a long dry September, and I disregarded this warning of mud only to be amazed by the sloppiness of the trail.  Turns out that even in the driest of conditions the mud isnt swayed; I would hate to attempt the trail during spring melt or autumn rains. Other than the mud the trail was pleasant and straightforward. The talus was relatively solid, and the final section of scrambling was only slightly exposed, but nonetheless enjoyable. Visibility increased throughout the day, not that it matted much with the great company I was with.  At first I took this photo as a joke, but then I ended up really liking it. These boots will never look this new again.  "

It was very exciting to have all of our Willows family members join us for our visiting day. We hope you had as much fun as we did.  While the temperature outside continued to rise, so did the fun and excitement. All the children had plenty of water breaks and extra time swimming to keep cool. Even the threat of rain didnt dampen our spirits. We had the opportunity to have an extra special snack of sandwich cookies decorated with icing and jimmies.  This weeks theme was Finding Nemo, and the Tadpoles and Minnows created CD fish door hangers in Camper Creations. At Ceramics, the campers enjoyed painting their clay hands and feet. All your childrens projects will be sent home shortly. On Wednesday, in preparation for Waterworld and to honor our weekly theme of Finding Nemo, many of our Tadpoles and Minnows attempted the giant water slide and loved it.  To end our wonderful week, The Willows campers joined the rest of camp at Waterworld. The children drove water boats and joined in other great water activities. A terrific time was had by all!  We are looking forward to the next four weeks with your children. As a reminder, please remember to label all items brought to camp and wear yellow as much as possible.

After 7 long years of silence local cult band Reverend Glasseye returns as a shaken and somber beast to kick off this frightful night of fun! Emerging in the 90s as one of the originators of the East coast's dark cabaret movement, the band solidified its place on the scene with its junk aesthetic and operatic bravadocombining American and East European folk music to eventually win Boston's Rock and Roll Rumble in 2005. Now Reverend Glasseye finally slouches again toward Bostonand with a return to its folk roots, the band has created a sound that is leaner and darker than ever! Following their set will be a bevy of grotesque burlesque courtesy of the infamous horror troupe, Black Cat Burlesque. Dedicated to putting the BUMP back into the night, Black Cat Burlesque has been raising pulses, the dead and a whole lot of hell since 2003. As the bad seeds of Boston Burlesque, this scream team mines the depths of their twisted psychesblending striptease thrills and spookshow chills to push the boundaries of the art form and explore the dark, cobwebbed corners of neo-cabaret.  For the nights feature, Mr. Cannibal has hand-picked Peter Jackson's perversely comic BAD TASTE, screening on 35 mm film! Driven by a wild combination of extreme gore, horror, and comedy: this seminal cult classic is an often forgotten classic from one of the world's most popular contemporary film makers. You definitely want to catch this one on the big screen!  Free gory goodie bags will be handed out to all, and J. Cannibal will award a number of prizes for the best zombie costumes.  Brought to you by the creative minds of Black Ocean, this will be a show of insanity from beyond the grave that you dont want to miss!

Cannibal, is a celebration of all things terrifying. The Improper Bostonian Think Rocky Horror Picture Show with less androgyny and more anthropophagy.

Landrake Moto Parc was founded in 1995 and is set in 25 acres of beautiful Cornish countryside, with the track taking approximately half of the site - the rest for paddock area and spectator parking. We also have another 10 acres for additional parking for the very large events. The track is 1900km long and is a minimum of 10 metres wide with some sections 15 metres wide and sits in a valley with trees on one side. With features such as a whoop section, raised berms, ski-ramps, step-downs and step-ups, and a laptime of over two minutes, exhilarating racing is ensured. 40 GP-standard start gates lead you to a 110 metre start straight, turning out into a wide downhill and then a chicane - followed by a very popular feature with spectators immediately in front of the pits - a table-top suitable for laying down some whips and scrubs, with a 100 foot tabletop right after!

Landrake Moto Parc was founded in 1995 and is set in 25 acres of beautiful Cornish countryside, with the track taking approximately half of the site - the rest for paddock area and spectator parking. We also have another 10 acres for additional parking for the very large events. The track is 1900km long and is a minimum of 10 metres wide with some sections 15 metres wide and sits in a valley with trees on one side. With features such as a whoop section, raised berms, ski-ramps, step-downs and step-ups, and a laptime of over two minutes, exhilarating racing is ensured. 40 GP-standard start gates lead you to a 110 metre start straight, turning out into a wide downhill and then a chicane - followed by a very popular feature with spectators immediately in front of the pits - a table-top suitable for laying down some whips and scrubs, with a 100 foot tabletop right after!

Pericles Kondylatos checked in room 705 at Fresh Hotel. Together with the jewellery, was displayed an art installation that resembled a car crash, and an exhibition of vintage photographs of car crashes. A blooded sheet, a wheel, broken speedometers, and ruins by an accident showed the scenery of a disaster. The theme was inspired by Symphorophilia, a psychological condition under which the individual finds sexual satisfaction in car crashes. Model: Nolle Koutra Special thanks to booker Dimitris Makris & the team of Ozon Magazine, especially George Kelefis.  The crash collection  Autumn  Winter 2014 -2105 The crash collection By Pericles Kondylatos is an  one of a kind  collection in dark colors for the winter. Made by vintage car labels that have been collected by ruined cars which were involved in accidents.  The crash collection is the first ever of its kind in the world that has been created by such materials and in this concept of having fatal objects to decorate the body. The intention of the artist is to create beautiful necklaces, created by compartments that carry a doomed fate. This collection arouses many questions about beauty, mortality and vanity: Can the buyers see them independently of their background story? Is the fashion world a place to explore the idea of mortality, death & tragedy? Is there beauty in the grotesque? Can an accident become the source of beauty? Is really life a big re-cycle? The crash collection: A tragedy redemption.  SYMPHOROPHILIA Symphorophilia is a paraphilia in which sexual arousal hinges on staging and watching a disaster, such as a fire or a traffic accident. The term was coined by John Money in his 1984 paper Paraphilias: Phenomenology and classification, formed from the Greek root """" (""symphora""):[1] A special form of sacrificial paraphilia, for which a suitable name is symphorophilia (being erotically turned on by accidents or catastrophes), culminates in an arranged disaster, such as an automobile crash. Like a game of Russian roulette, it may end in death  alone or with the partner. However, flirting with disaster, rather than suicide and murder is the trigger responsible for autoerotic arousal and excitement. Being the daredevil who will live to risk a love-death again is an essential part of this paraphilia. As a photographic print is the positive made from its negative, so also the positive of self-crashing is arranging for a disaster to occur on the highway, and then watching the carnage from a preselected observation post. Disasters other than on the highway may be arranged  catastrophic fires, for example. For those members of the general public who have a touch of sadomasochism in them, disaster as an unrehearsed event is often a large part of the appeal of entertainment stunts and sports, from the circus to stock-car racing.

I spent NYE on Granville St in Vancouver BC with two other fantastic photographers capturing the fun of the evening. We lined up side-by-side, many people thought we were with a newspaper or that we knew something really amazing was just about to take place and they asked what it was and wanted to watch too. I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over. I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol. I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.   Some of the photos might seem a bit strange with the movement/blur but I find them artistic and you can find some interesting pictures within a photo when you let yourself just look without expectations. You may also notice the odd clear face/s that paused in all the movement & excitement. All in all, everyone was having a fantastic time!!  If you see yourself in any of the pictures on my Facebook page, please tag yourself and then share the photos to your friends & family. If you like my page then you will get notified for when I post the rest of the pictures which are coming soon! www.facebook.com/AnnaHallPhotographer  Thank YOU for posing for me and bringing such great energy to NYE!!"

I gained knowledge of the history of the Inuits, and experienced first hand how contiguous borders impact one's internal development. On a weekend trip to Niagara Falls I saw the power of water! Winter was already upon us and yet the force of the volume of water coming from the Fall's source was such that it flowed as though it were the middle of Summer. The strength of the spray also coming off the water could be felt over a mile away. Coming from an island paradise where tiny waterfalls are a source of excitement for hikers; seeing the power of the Niagara Falls was indeed amazing!"

Landrake Moto Parc was founded in 1995 and is set in 25 acres of beautiful Cornish countryside, with the track taking approximately half of the site - the rest for paddock area and spectator parking. We also have another 10 acres for additional parking for the very large events. The track is 1900km long and is a minimum of 10 metres wide with some sections 15 metres wide and sits in a valley with trees on one side. With features such as a whoop section, raised berms, ski-ramps, step-downs and step-ups, and a laptime of over two minutes, exhilarating racing is ensured. 40 GP-standard start gates lead you to a 110 metre start straight, turning out into a wide downhill and then a chicane - followed by a very popular feature with spectators immediately in front of the pits - a table-top suitable for laying down some whips and scrubs, with a 100 foot tabletop right after! All this with superb viewing for specatators.   Whilst the track is fast and flowing, its a very technical track, with some old-school features such as adverse cambers and natural terrain, combined with some man-made jumps, along with a rythm section to add to the excitement for riders and spectators alike. So, riders need sublime skills to get a winning lap here.

I spent NYE on Granville St in Vancouver BC with two other fantastic photographers capturing the fun of the evening. We lined up side-by-side, many people thought we were with a newspaper or that we knew something really amazing was just about to take place and they asked what it was and wanted to watch too. I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over. I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol. I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.   Some of the photos might seem a bit strange with the movement/blur but I find them artistic and you can find some interesting pictures within a photo when you let yourself just look without expectations. You may also notice the odd clear face/s that paused in all the movement & excitement. All in all, everyone was having a fantastic time!!

I spent NYE on Granville St in Vancouver BC with two other fantastic photographers capturing the fun of the evening. We lined up side-by-side, many people thought we were with a newspaper or that we knew something really amazing was just about to take place and they asked what it was and wanted to watch too. I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over. I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol. I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.   Some of the photos might seem a bit strange with the movement/blur but I find them artistic and you can find some interesting pictures within a photo when you let yourself just look without expectations. You may also notice the odd clear face/s that paused in all the movement & excitement. All in all, everyone was having a fantastic time!!  If you see yourself in any of the pictures on my Facebook page, please tag yourself and then share the photos to your friends & family.

After 7 long years of silence local cult band Reverend Glasseye returns as a shaken and somber beast to kick off this frightful night of fun! Emerging in the 90s as one of the originators of the East coast's dark cabaret movement, the band solidified its place on the scene with its junk aesthetic and operatic bravadocombining American and East European folk music to eventually win Boston's Rock and Roll Rumble in 2005. Now Reverend Glasseye finally slouches again toward Bostonand with a return to its folk roots, the band has created a sound that is leaner and darker than ever! Following their set will be a bevy of grotesque burlesque courtesy of the infamous horror troupe, Black Cat Burlesque. Dedicated to putting the BUMP back into the night, Black Cat Burlesque has been raising pulses, the dead and a whole lot of hell since 2003.

Landrake Moto Parc was founded in 1995 and is set in 25 acres of beautiful Cornish countryside, with the track taking approximately half of the site - the rest for paddock area and spectator parking. We also have another 10 acres for additional parking for the very large events. The track is 1900km long and is a minimum of 10 metres wide with some sections 15 metres wide and sits in a valley with trees on one side. With features such as a whoop section, raised berms, ski-ramps, step-downs and step-ups, and a laptime of over two minutes, exhilarating racing is ensured. 40 GP-standard start gates lead you to a 110 metre start straight, turning out into a wide downhill and then a chicane - followed by a very popular feature with spectators immediately in front of the pits - a table-top suitable for laying down some whips and scrubs, with a 100 foot tabletop right after! All this with superb viewing for specatators.   Whilst the track is fast and flowing, its a very technical track, with some old-school features such as adverse cambers and natural terrain, combined with some man-made jumps, along with a rythm section to add to the excitement for riders and spectators alike. So, riders need sublime skills to get a winning lap here.

With just a touch of theatre and a presence of performance dreams can flicker into reality, through a break in the crowd they can begin to take form.  Sometimes we are fortunate enough to have a small imp filled painting box with which to record the light fall and the shadow up play.

There was personal redemption, too, for Carli Lloyd, who answered her missed kick in that 3-1 shootout loss by scoring a goal in each half to seal the Olympic crown for her nation.  Japan were dubbed the Barcelona of the women's game for their flurry of neat passing and slick movement and their average height of 5ft 4in compared to the US's 5ft 7in. The Americans were the big tournament specialists. This was the fifth women's Olympic final and USA were continuing their record of being in all of them, losing only to Norway at Sydney 2000, 3-2.  For Japan, their coach Norio Sasaki framed the attempted conquest of gold as part of the country's healing process, following the trauma of last year's earthquake which killed nearly 20,000 people.  Ahead of this final he said: ""All the Japanese people are still trying to come back from the earthquake disaster.  ""Winning the World Cup was very emotional last year and gave energy to the nation after what had happened and the same can happen again.""  After eight minutes a noisy, though not completely filled Wembley, witnessed the opening strike. Tobin Heath galloped into space down the left before Alex Morgan's twist and cross was met by Carli Lloyd, just ahead of the 143-goal Abby Wambach.  Far from being unsettled, Japan went in search of an instant reply. A shot from Nahomi Kawasumi was blocked by the USA captain, Christie Rampone, with Hope Solo, the keeper, stranded. Yuki Ogimi followed up but could not convert.  Ogimi went closer moments later. A hanging jump was followed by the forward's header being superbly palmed onto the bar b y Solo.  The goal-frame proved an extra defender for both sides. Amy LePeilbet's cross was met with a glancing header by Rampone that hit Yuki Fukomoto's right post. At the opposite end, Aya Miyama's pile-driver smashed back off the bar.  Ogimi was instrumental in every Japan attack. Her lay-off nine minutes from half-time was hit with a menacing curl by Shinobu Ohno but the ball was marginally wide of the post.  The open, entertaining nature of this contest continued after the break. Japan spread the ball across midfield only for their attacks to founder due to a belief deficit. When given sight of goal  as Miyama, the captain, on 52 minutes  the opportunity was snatched at.  When America flooded forward there was menace. After Megan Rapinoe laid the ball into Lloyd, she surged from near half-way then unloaded a 20-yard humdinger that gave the 5ft 4in keeper Fukumoto no chance, and that was 2-0 to Pia Sunhage's team.  In the 63nd minute Japan's Ogimi raised the excitement scale to fevered after her strike, though this proved a consolation as the neat triangles that were ending in cul-de-sacs continued to frustrate the Japanese.  The world champions still had their chances but when Miyama had two free-kicks to deliver in quick succession, her side failed to profit."

I spent NYE on Granville St in Vancouver BC with two other fantastic photographers capturing the fun of the evening. We lined up side-by-side, many people thought we were with a newspaper or that we knew something really amazing was just about to take place and they asked what it was and wanted to watch too. I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over. I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol. I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.   Some of the photos might seem a bit strange with the movement/blur but I find them artistic and you can find some interesting pictures within a photo when you let yourself just look without expectations. You may also notice the odd clear face/s that paused in all the movement & excitement. All in all, everyone was having a fantastic time!!  If you see yourself in any of the pictures on my Facebook page, please tag yourself and then share the photos to your friends & family. If you like my page then you will get notified for when I post the rest of the pictures which are coming soon! www.facebook.com/AnnaHallPhotographer  Thank YOU for posing for me and bringing such great energy to NYE!!"

excitement,http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7468/16085644681_ebe48ec5a9_z.jpg,2,3,"1 Farzi is one restaurant I have wanted to be at the most but it, ironically, has taken me the longest. The reasons for this happening were plenty but I finally made it to Farzi last week and there was a sense of excitement and relief in equal measure.   The place is funky, chic and bohemian but I would not want to delve on it any more as it takes my focus away from what makes Farzi the best new restaurant in town - food and drinks.   Many people label the food here as molecular gastronomy but I think its akin to calling all Indian food ""curry""; it strips away from the complexity of what's on your plate. Farzi is multi sensory cooking (as Blumenthal says); you don't just eat with your tongue but your eyes and other senses. Yes, there are elements of molecular gastronomy involved but (as my review ahead will tell) it is more a take on taking classic combinations or flavours and twisting them around.    Anyway, gyaan aside, our evening began with a mishti doi lollipop. Molecular gastronomy, spherification to be precise, was visible here. As soon as you bite into it though, you get that fabulous sweet and tart hit of mishti doi. Even though it was presented in such a fancy way, it tasted amazing and authentic.    Next came a drink called Apple Foamtini - a take on the classic apple martini, this had a light frothy apple flavoured foam and then a tart, cold hit of the great martini. Brilliant combination and a great drink this.   Next on the menu was a mini raj kachori with okra and chutney foam. Yeah, raj kachori with crisp okra and a chutney foam!! - mind blown. The kachori was stuffed with dahi, green chutney and the works but guess what, it was completely closed. After this piece of sorcery, when I tasted the kachori it was as good as any Delhi- 6 outlet. The chutney foam gave the ""saunth kick"" but it was way lighter. The crisp okra was great and I was told that the idea behind okra was that it goes well with yoghurt.    This, I believe, is the spirit of Farzi. The moment you bite into the food (or sip a drink) it feels familiar and utterly delectable. Also, every element has a reason to be there, not just to be fancy.   Next came a light, refreshing orange-vanilla drink called Farzi OK. Balanced, sweet and sour with a very light flavour of kaffir lime, this is what you will want to drink all evening.   Next came a portion of chilli pork ribs. Very well cooked ribs with a slathering of luscious chilli sauce. Wonderful.   I moved onto one of the many superstars on the menu (tapas menu), sarson ke gilawat with corn and cheese tostadas. Sarson ka saag becomes a FANTASTIC sarson gilawat kebab here. The makki di roti takes the form of corn (makki) popcorn. Corn and cheese tostadas provide warmth and there are even elements of safed makhan, sirka and pyaaz in this. You will fall in love.   The gastronomic adventure took me to my favourite dish amongst the pantheon of dishes - tenderloin pathar ke kabab with walnut and wasabi chutney. I'd say if you like meat, have this dish. If you do not like meat, have this dish. Dammit, if you are vegetarian - have this dish!!!! - it is that good.    In between we had a palette cleanser- rose water and coconut payasam foam with rose petal dust before the prawn tempura with nimbu chutney foam arrived. I have never had better prawn tempura in my life, period. I have to write a bigger review on this alone but lets leave that for now.   I had the braised lamb chops next along with cheeni ka paratha with duck liver maska. Cheeni ka paratha was farzified with a foie gras butter and all I could think of was why mom never served such delicious ""cheeni ka parathas"" when I was younger.    I had the chilli duck samosas, pulled pork bun and the galouti burger next. I am running out of space to write about how brilliant each dish was. The samosa was halwai khasta; the duck was flavourful and the sweet plum sauce brought the entire dish together.    Similarly, the pulled pork bun was So Goan yet so Farzi. There was flavour from the pork; the buns gave it airiness and the Goan puffed rice gave it crunch. *drool*    The gilawat burger came in a box and the soft and magnificent galouti was given a bit of bite by a layer of boti kebab. You have to admire the thought process.    The Mutton Irachi pepper fry came along with a malabari paratha and was sublime but the icing on the cake was the gucchi pulao risotto. Perfectly creamy risotto with morsels of expensive gucchi topped with a salty parmesan crisp. You have to taste it to understand how brilliantly flavours work together.    The CTM or chicken tikka masala came in a London telephone booth, what a cheeky idea. I will say that the ""national dish"" of Britain tasted way better at Farzi.    There are three special drinks I will recommend. The flaming Farzi tower was an event on its own  flambed shots (Baileys, Sambucca, Vodka, Kahlua and Absinthe) caramelizes and forms a drink at the bottom. The red wine spaghetti shots were great too  acidic and sweet and it was a vision as well. Finally, there was the B-52 bomber that was basically B-52 shooters, spherified, so in effect you eat the shot!   Yes I had a tiny speck left in my stomach to try desserts and the best two came. The Parle G cheesecake is the most photographed Farzi dessert on the web and it tasted as good as it looked. My question before tasting it was if the Parle G would really work with a creamy cheesecake and voila, it does. It lends the dish crunch and saltiness - splendid.   The other dessert - rasmali tres leches was even better. First of all you need to admire it as it sits on your table - its that pretty. Then you start eating it to try and understand how brilliant the flavours are. The sponge is three layered filled with carrot cream bathing in ""rasmalai"" milk. If this dish does not Farzify you, I dont know what will.   The evening ended with a final flourish - gujiya shaped, pan flavoured cotton candy!! The pan was dehydrated and it gave a delightful punch. You know how it tasted but it also brought a tinge of nostalgia with it. Farzi is all about that - senses, flavours and a little bit of magic.   Lastly, we do not just have to applaud Zorawar, Chef Saurabh and the entire team behind Farzi but give them a very loud, ""Dilliwala"" wolf whistle for bringing Farzi to us.   #Farzified forever.

Landrake Moto Parc was founded in 1995 and is set in 25 acres of beautiful Cornish countryside, with the track taking approximately half of the site - the rest for paddock area and spectator parking. We also have another 10 acres for additional parking for the very large events. The track is 1900km long and is a minimum of 10 metres wide with some sections 15 metres wide and sits in a valley with trees on one side. With features such as a whoop section, raised berms, ski-ramps, step-downs and step-ups, and a laptime of over two minutes, exhilarating racing is ensured. 40 GP-standard start gates lead you to a 110 metre start straight, turning out into a wide downhill and then a chicane - followed by a very popular feature with spectators immediately in front of the pits - a table-top suitable for laying down some whips and scrubs, with a 100 foot tabletop right after! All this with superb viewing for specatators.   Whilst the track is fast and flowing, its a very technical track, with some old-school features such as adverse cambers and natural terrain, combined with some man-made jumps, along with a rythm section to add to the excitement for riders and spectators alike. So, riders need sublime skills to get a winning lap here. LMP has been used for MAXXIS British Championship rounds with top riders such as 3-times World Champion Dave Thorpe and World Grand Prix riders including  Brad Anderson, Elliott Banks Browne, Steven Clarke, Tommy Searle, Billy Mackenzie, Ken De-Dycker (Holland), Zac Osborne (USA), Josh Coppins from New Zealand, Ryan Rhino Hughes from California, USA., Carl Nunn, James Noble,  Stephen Sword, Tom Church, Mark Eastwood, Mattis Karro from Latvia- the list goes on and on.

It was very exciting to have all of our Willows family members join us for our visiting day. We hope you had as much fun as we did.  While the temperature outside continued to rise, so did the fun and excitement. All the children had plenty of water breaks and extra time swimming to keep cool. Even the threat of rain didnt dampen our spirits. We had the opportunity to have an extra special snack of sandwich cookies decorated with icing and jimmies.  This weeks theme was Finding Nemo, and the Tadpoles and Minnows created CD fish door hangers in Camper Creations. At Ceramics, the campers enjoyed painting their clay hands and feet. All your childrens projects will be sent home shortly. On Wednesday, in preparation for Waterworld and to honor our weekly theme of Finding Nemo, many of our Tadpoles and Minnows attempted the giant water slide and loved it.  To end our wonderful week, The Willows campers joined the rest of camp at Waterworld. The children drove water boats and joined in other great water activities. A terrific time was had by all!  We are looking forward to the next four weeks with your children. As a reminder, please remember to label all items brought to camp and wear yellow as much as possible.  About Willow Grove Day Camp Willow Grove Day Camp provides summer fun for kids who live in Willow Grove, Abington, Blue Bell, Hatboro, Horsham, Huntingdon Valley, Lafayette Hill, Philadelphia, Plymouth Meeting, Southampton and the surrounding areas.

At first, I wanted to crop it down, so it was more focused on Jaz, and you could see more detail, like his fingers in the dirt, the look in his eye.

I spent NYE on Granville St in Vancouver BC with two other fantastic photographers capturing the fun of the evening. We lined up side-by-side, many people thought we were with a newspaper or that we knew something really amazing was just about to take place and they asked what it was and wanted to watch too. I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over. I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol. I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.   Some of the photos might seem a bit strange with the movement/blur but I find them artistic and you can find some interesting pictures within a photo when you let yourself just look without expectations. You may also notice the odd clear face/s that paused in all the movement & excitement. All in all, everyone was having a fantastic time!!

I spent NYE on Granville St in Vancouver BC with two other fantastic photographers capturing the fun of the evening. We lined up side-by-side, many people thought we were with a newspaper or that we knew something really amazing was just about to take place and they asked what it was and wanted to watch too. I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over. I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol. I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.   Some of the photos might seem a bit strange with the movement/blur but I find them artistic and you can find some interesting pictures within a photo when you let yourself just look without expectations.

The crew at Detroit Speed was overly excited to get to Columbus and when they did, as always, it didn't disappoint. With the autocross sponsor shootout, Detroit Speed's latest creation, Angelo Vespi's 1969 Camaro unveiling, as well as a full weekend of autocross action, there was no shortage of excitement at the Columbus expo center during the long weekend.

I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over.

Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.

I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.

However, it is also part of a series of pieces featuring the same scene. My last attempt done in 2005 was lacking in many areas including overall accuracy, and I felt that with the release of Skyward Sword, all of the 25th Anniversary Legend of Zelda stuff, and the excitement of putting together my own Dungeons & Dragons-style table-top Zelda game, it was about time to show off my skills again with a revival of this project. Another thing that also contributed to the creation of this piece was the release of high-resolution official artwork from Ocarina of Time, in particular, that of Ganon. I could now get the accuracy I wanted and use the talent I had been honing throughout my time at the College for Creative Studies.  I cannot even fathom the number of hours I've spent on this, but it is considerable. The Master Sword and Hylian Shield alone took at least 20 hours each. I wasn't going to settle for anything short of perfection this time around. Everything in this image I drew from the ground up except for the manipulated ground and sky textures, which were taken from photographs. I also used textures to enhance the quality of metal, leather, cloth, skin, and horns.   For the art critics looking at this, my desire was to portray the dread and anticipation of an epic battle with the King of Evil reborn as a demon. I think anyone who has played the game felt the same way when Ganondorf rose from the dead and transformed into a monstrous beast before their eyes. I've seen many other depictions of the battle that are more action-packed or stylized, but my primary goal was accuracy, providing a sense of nostalgia for that moment, and recreating it in a way that gamers imagined the battle looking in real life.   For you die-hard Zelda fans out there, you may notice a few things that are different. The Master Sword I used is the design from Twilight Princess / Skyward Sword, mostly because it just looks so much more epic and finished than the simple design from Ocarina of Time. Also, the scabbard is from the design of those games, but this is mostly due the fact that I feel that Nintendo has desired to make the new design canon (since that scabbard design is in games that take place before and after Ocarina chronologically). Link is also wearing chainmail beneath his green tunic, which I felt would probably be more likely for an adventurer who is somehow able to withstand many enemy strikes (and once again is present in TP / SS). Navi actually has a physical humanoid body, as opposed to a simple winged, glowing orb. Fairies are clearly seen to have humanoid bodies in most of the other games, as well as the Great Fairies within Ocarina, so I felt for realism's sake, Navi should have a body. I attempted to give a little bit of a ""forest fairy"" flair to her, similar to the Great Fairies, but lesser. And finally, I added the Gerudo symbol to the Golden Gauntlets, mostly because they were admittedly rather plain and I felt that since the Silver Gauntlets were found in the Spirit Temple and Golden ones in Ganon's Castle, they might be of ancient Gerudo origin themselves.   Anyway, please leave feedback! And you can view the full resolution image on my DeviantArt."

Landrake Moto Parc was founded in 1995 and is set in 25 acres of beautiful Cornish countryside, with the track taking approximately half of the site - the rest for paddock area and spectator parking. We also have another 10 acres for additional parking for the very large events. The track is 1900km long and is a minimum of 10 metres wide with some sections 15 metres wide and sits in a valley with trees on one side. With features such as a whoop section, raised berms, ski-ramps, step-downs and step-ups, and a laptime of over two minutes, exhilarating racing is ensured. 40 GP-standard start gates lead you to a 110 metre start straight, turning out into a wide downhill and then a chicane - followed by a very popular feature with spectators immediately in front of the pits - a table-top suitable for laying down some whips and scrubs, with a 100 foot tabletop right after! All this with superb viewing for specatators.   Whilst the track is fast and flowing, its a very technical track, with some old-school features such as adverse cambers and natural terrain, combined with some man-made jumps, along with a rythm section to add to the excitement for riders and spectators alike. So, riders need sublime skills to get a winning lap here.

While the temperature outside continued to rise, so did the fun and excitement. All the children had plenty of water breaks and extra time swimming to keep cool. This weeks theme was Monkey Business. The Tadpoles and Minnows created monkey around door hangers. In Ceramics, the campers enjoyed painting their clay hands and feet. All your childrens projects will be sent home shortly.   Picture day for the Minnows was a huge success as the campers and staff had big smiles on their faces. Remember, picture day for the Tadpoles is next week on Tuesday, July 24th .
