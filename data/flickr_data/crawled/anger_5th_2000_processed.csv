About 200 people attended the event in St Enoch Square, which is part of the larger 'Bring Back Our Girls' campaign.  Security forces are still searching for the students, who were abducted by Boko Haram Islamist militants on 14 April.  The group condemns those who have been educated in the ""Western"" system, and opposes the education of women.  The Boko Haram insurgency has left thousands dead since 2009.  The missing girls, from the town of Chibok in north eastern Nigeria, are in their final year of school, and most of them are aged 16 to 18.  They are thought to be held in the Sambisa forest, a remote and inaccessible area of country.   The protest was part of the 'Bring Back Our Girls' campaign  Josephine Adekola, a representative of the Nigerian community in Glasgow, said: ""Every Nigerian across the world, wherever they are, feels frustration and anger about this.  ""There's real concern and anxiety about Boko Haram and we want our government to stand up and do something about it.  ""We're sending a message to Nigerians that people here are concerned and we want the mothers who are going through this grief to understand that we feel their pain.  ""We want answers from the Nigerian government and we want our girls back.""  Event organiser Megan Mitchell told BBC Scotland: ""We want to raise awareness on this issue and we won't be silent. We're a month down the line from these girls going missing and there's been inaction from governments, charities, the media and international community.  ""We're calling on people to write to their MSPs, their MPs, local government and charities and make their voices heard.  ""If ordinary people are taking to the streets and saying this is an important issue, governments and international organisations will listen."" "

Marchers came from all around the Midlands and beyond. Trade Union banners showed the breadth of union participation. Marchers were angry at the role the Lib Dems have played in propping up the Tories in office. From Fees to Academies to cuts, no matter what the issue, the Lib Dems are helping the Tories drive through their policies of privatisation and cuts.  In 2 weeks time thousands more will gather to march on the Tory conference. On 30th November up to 3 million public sector workers will strike against the ConDem attacks on pensions.  Speakers from the platform reflected the breadth of anger and resistance that exists in society. Mary Bousted from the ATL said that unequal distribution of wealth means kids come to school anxious because parents fear losing job. Mark Serwotka from the PCS said that  November 30 will be biggest strike for generations  we have to fight to win the ballots. He condemned Ed Miliband for condemning strikes and said he should side with workers fighting back. He ended his speech with  Fight every cut! Defend every job. Free education. Tax the rich!   Christine Blower from the NUT said she was proud her members were on strike on June 30 and they will be out on November30. We will defend our pensions. Fight on every campaign. Billy Hayes from the CWU announced to cheers that Posties wont cross picket Lines on November 30th  Right to Work is proud of the role we have played in this demonstration. We initially called the demonstration before the TUC decided to run one themselves. We were pleased with their decision to do this. Right to Work placards ran through the demonstration, reflecting the role Right to Work has played in the last few weeks in leafletting and mobilising for the demo.  250 people packed the Right to Work rally after the demonstration.

AT&T picked my house - and the old utility easement in front of it - as the first stop in their build-out to expand high speed internet and video service. Fiber Optic bundle will go to a rather large (4 ft square by 5 foot box with attached heat pump on 6 ft slab) DSLAM box.   Only problem is... their maps are wrong! They were wrong 20 years ago, and they are still wrong!   They notified me by a letter dated 2/19/2007 that I received on Friday, 3/2/2007!  The letter didn't say when digging would begin or what equipment would be installed. Knowing the problems from installation 20 years before (I had to stand in front yard, refusing to move, until the agreed to move the location!), I tried calling them over the weekend, but, of course, no one was home at their office. I left a message.   By the time they'd called me back, left a message and I was able to talk to them at lunch the following Monday, it was 1pm and the hole seen here was dug and ready for step 2.  Needless to say, I was furious!  Ever try and find an attorney who'd take a case against AT&T on contingency? Good luck!  They have since moved it to the other (west) side of the existing box, but my yard is still a mess and the driveway's less-than-2-year-old gravel surface chewed up pretty good.   Despite my extreme anger over the way this was conducted, I never bothered to mention I was chairman of the Cable TV Advisory Committee of Beloit. Their letter never mentioned video services as part of this construction, but that's what this is about - bring video service over telephone lines to compete with Cable franchises.  As long as it's called ""communications service"" they can build under existing grandfathered right-of-ways. If they mention video, they enter an whole 'nuther regulatory environment and open a can of worms they expect to see superceeded with new regulations before too long. (Wisconsin is expected to consider and pass such legislation soon... unless the hapless feds do it first.)    This ain't over yet... not by a long shot. "

Mary continued to glare at him and then shoved him a second time. This shove was stronger though and he ended up falling down. He sat on the ground looking up at her until the two boys ran forward, throwing kicks at him. He cupped his head in his hands and curled into a ball, taking the kicks from all three.

He saw each kick as a blow of the hammer to the can, and the hot searing pain in his side as the welding machine, sticking the bottom of the lamp to the top.

It was the biggest demonstration against the government since David Cameron went into Downing Street.  Students and lecturers take the initiative and give a focus for the hatred millions feel about the Tory cuts and gave confidence that militant protest is the way to push back the attacks.  The 50,000 students, lecturers and other protesters who took to the streets were fighting 9,000-a-year tuition fees that will close university education to most working class students. They are also fighting against the cuts in courses and staff, and the ending of the Education Maintenance Allowance.  The mood of anger that has swept Europe arrived in London. The lively protest was filled with anger as protestors chanted Tory scum.  But they were also revolting about much more too. The demoand the occupation of the Tory headquarters in the Millbank Towerwere a sign of the fury against the Tories pampering the rich while assaulting the poor.  And it showed the anger at a society where profit comes before any human need. Tory headquarters at Millbank is the symbol of all that.  As the demonstration marched past, a large group broke away into the buildings courtyard. Then some occupied the foyer.  More and more joined them until up to 5,000 students and lecturers were protesting against the Tories blocking the road outside. They brushed aside the few police officers defending the Tory tower.  Protesters lit bonfires in the courtyard and chanted against the Tories.  Some demonstrators smashed several of the buildings front windowsto massive cheers. And protesters on the pavement sat on office chairs, and a sofa theyd removed from the building."

The Indigenous Australians were the original owners of the Australian house, but when England finally threw out Australia, he (and his mates) barged in, beat them up and took over all the best rooms. They weren't even allowed  back into the main part of the house until 1967.  Relations have (very) slowly improved since then. Theres still a lot of anger and resentment on all sides, and the Indigenous Australians are still arguing for compensation, but they at least received a (slightly grudging in some cases) apology from the others a few years back.  The tallest guy is Aboriginal Australia. He's depicted with a Western Desert dot painting and a didgeridoo because when the rest of the world thinks of him at all, that's what they expect him to have. He's looking askance at a beer bottle because (like Greenland) he's had problems with alcohol.  The shorter man is his brother Torres Straight Islands. He's small because people tend to forget about him in favour of Aboriginal Australia. Nonetheless he managed to get the non Indigenous Australians to agree that they should give back some of the rooms.  Their sister is Pallawah, or Tasmanian Aboriginal. Everyone thought that she was killed in the fight when Australia invaded the house, but she's recently re-emerged, saying she was just keeping a low profile (this doesn't stop some people claiming she's an imposter). She's wearing a traditional Tasmanian shell necklace."

About 7.000 people took on the streets of Hamburg, in order to demonstrate against rising housing rents and gentrification in vast areas of the inner city, including St. Pauli, Schanzenviertel and Altona. Living and housing costs are getting such high that most of the residents are no longer able to afford living in their quarters.   Within the growing movement right to the city, more and more people get involved and show their anger in different ways and forms. The main demand is to take out housing from the capital market, by political means.  Hamburg politics and police were eager to build up a riot scenario, by deploying hundreds of police with heavy riot gear in close contact to the demonstrators. Yet the demonstration passed peacefully "

London, 15.05.2011    In what proved to be a tense, often volatile demonstration yesterday, pro-Palestinian protesters gathered to celebrate ""Yamn an-Nakbah"" - the ""day of catastrophe"" which refers to the forced displacement of the palestinian people following the creation of the state of Israel in 1948, and to condemn the continuing violent occupation of Palestine. The Arab protesters were vigorously opposed by a much smaller counter-protest group of Israelis, whose meagre numbers were disproportionately increased by several members of the English Defence League (EDL) and its offshoot, March for England (MfE), which are both Ultra-Nationalist supremacy groups.  Penned up by the police within close range to each other, there were frequent provocative moves made by both sides, taunting and insulting each other, and occasionally individuals would escape the barriers and run over to the opposition group to openly taunt them. The bitterness and anger hung like a thick fog in the air. Across the road on the opposite pavement two smaller groups protested too, kept apart by ever-increasing numbers of police as the temperature rose amongst the more hot-headed protesters, each hoping to antagonise the other into some kind of physical reaction to their taunts. Passers-by were clearly intimidated by the growing tension, and hurried nervously by on the crowded pavement.  The police did an admirable job of containing the situation without resorting to strong-arm tactics, quickly diffusing pockets of potential trouble as they arose. There was one arrest before I left.

I was relieved when the response from my text message said, ""I don't care who you date, as long as they treat you right and you're happy. But I'm not telling your grandmother.""  I recently met someone, and finally decided not to hide who I am anymore. We made it Facebook official, and by that night I was getting angry text messages from my mom. The text messages were followed by angry emails the next morning, rambling on about how this isn't right or normal, and how she didn't dream this for me. I've never been so angry.

Police managed to clear them from the shopping centre, but were unable to prevent the looters from smashing the windows of several local businesses along Queensway. I arrived about ten minutes after the mob had moved off towards Paddington, from where some of them went North to create trouble in other boroughs. There had been various claims on Twitter of cars and taxis being set alight in Paddington, but on the ground there was no evidence. I cycled through Paddington and down to Oxford Street to see a heavy police presence outside Selfridges, Top Shop and Vodafone - which have all been targets this year because of their reputations for massive tax avoidance - but there was no trouble along London's famous shopping street tonight, though it's inevitable that it'll happen soon unless the Metropolitan police start adopting more robust tactics, which always means people get injured or worse, and further erosion of everyone's civil liberties.  Instead, the trouble tonight moved to Ealing in the West, and Camden and Enfield in the North of the city, resulting in  widespread damage, looting and arson attacks on cars, businesses and, more terrifyingly, peoples' homes.  Millions of frightened Londoners are collectively holding their breath, waiting to see what happens to their city next. Will the marauding packs of feral thugs, thieves and gang-members intent on mindless destruction and violence continue to terrorize our streets or will the authorities start protecting their citizenry rather than cutting vital funding and causing the deprivation and hardship which has been the fuel for this explosion of violent anger?

I am usually an easy cryer.  I cry at touching commercials...dumb stuff.  But that day I didn't cry a single tear.  I've never been that horrified or shocked or sick or ANGRY.  I've had the opportunity to visit ground zero since then...there I cried.  I cried in St. Johns Church where the firefighters rested between shifts.  I cried as a couple got on their knees and prayed at the site.  It's good to cry...it's good to feel the sorrow and anger.  It's important for our country never to forget...always to feel...

In December 2012, it was forced to remove a Facebook update which suggested that if Jesus lived in the modern world he would probably end up being lynched in Bethlehem by hostile Palestinians.  Sinn Fein foreign affairs spokesman Sean Crowe was shocked by the latest images. He said: On one hand its childish and lacks maturity, but when you consider 1,050 people have been killed, its wrong to be making light of the situation.  Expel Israeli Ambassador over Gaza slaughter - Adams  Sinn Fin Leader Gerry Adams TD has called for a diplomatic offensive by the Irish Government to encourage the Government of Israel to end it's military onslaught against the civilian population in the Gaza Strip.  Mr Adams welcomed the decision by The Minister for Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan to meet the Israeli Ambassador following the escalation of the Israeli Government's military offensive in Gaza but said the time had come to expel the Ambassador.  Speaking today Gerry Adams said:  ""Today marks the 17th anniversary of the IRA cessation in 1997. This is a timely reminder of the efficacy of dialogue and inclusive negotiation as an alternative to protracted armed conflict.  ""That principle is as applicable today to the situation in the Middle East as it was to Ireland in 1997.  ""The decision of the Minister for Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan to meet the Israeli Ambassador, following the escalation of the Israeli Government's military onslaught against the besieged population of the Gaza Strip, is welcome.  ""However the time has long past for merely expressing concern to a Government that is clearly oblivious to the outrage of the international community at their actions in Gaza.  ""Irish citizens have been upset and angered at the ongoing killing of men, women and children in Gaza.  ""All armed actions, including attacks from Gaza must stop.  'In 2009, following a fact finding mission to Gaza I published a report which proposed nine immediate steps to help resolve the conflict. They were:  1. All armed actions and acts of violence should cease.  2. An inclusive process of negotiation should commence in which all democratic mandates are respected, clear objectives are set, and there is a fixed timeframe.  3. The building of the separation wall should stop as a first step which would see its demolition.  4. The siege of the Gaza strip should end.  5. An immediate and intensive programme of reconstruction and economic development must commence.  6. The ongoing Israeli colonisation of the West Bank and the building of settlements should stop.  7. The occupation of the West Bank and the denial of freedom of movement to Palestinians in the West Bank and in the Gaza strip, and between the West Bank and Gaza, should end as part of the process to decolonise the West Bank.  8. Mutual and expeditious co-operation between Palestinians and Israelis to enhance public safety and security should commence.  9. UN resolutions and international law should be enforced.  ""Five years later, none of these steps have been taken and the situation has deteriorated once again.  ""The decision by the Israeli Government, in the face of international anger, to escalate its military offensive by launching a ground offensive requires a firm and resolute response by the Irish Government, which must now expel the Israeli Ambassador.  ""The Irish Government should also push for the immediate suspension of the EUs preferential trade agreements (Israel-EU Association Agreement and Euro-Med Agreement) with Israel."""
