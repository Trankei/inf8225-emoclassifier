This is my Mother.  In November 2009, my Mum suffered a major stroke and was left in a wheelchair and without the ability to speak fluently.  Her speech is slowly coming back as is the movement in her right leg, her right arm however has lost it's ability to be funcional.  Mum now lives in a nursing home as the high level of expertise care required by her is above what me and my family can offer, we visit daily to keep her spirits up. Most days this vibrant and beautiful woman shows a resiliance so strong and so inspirational, however, on other days, like when this was taken, you can see the internal struggle to stay positive in the face of her apparent limitations.  This woman is my hero, my inspiration, my joy, this woman is my Mum."

It's always nice to know that what one finds to be beautiful can sometimes align with what others feel and then reinforces that emotion to an even higher plane--that is community!  This is my eldest son Aydan's face and the only reason I know of this wonderful poem is because I was looking for something that would speak of the relationship of Parent and child to compliment this image on Flickr. I am very excited about this community and it's not perfect but much better than any social network I have been a part of outside of my family blog.  Thanks again everyone! ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////  [The Giving Tree] by Shel Silverstein  Once there was a giving tree who loved a little boy. And everyday the boy would come to play Swinging from the branches, sleeping in the shade Laughing all the summers hours away. And so they love,  Oh, the tree was happy. Oh, the tree was glad.   But soon the boy grew older and one day he came and said, ""Can you give me some money, tree, to buy something Ive found?"" ""I have no money,"" said the tree, ""Just apples, twigs and leaves."" ""But you can take my apples, boy, and sell them in the town."" And so he did and  Oh, the tree was happy. Oh, the tree was glad.  But soon again the boy came back and he said to the tree, ""Im now a man and I must have a house thats all my home."" ""I cant give you a house"" he said, ""The forest is my house."" ""But you may cut my branches off and build yourself a home"" And so he did. Oh, the tree was happy. Oh, the tree was glad.  And time went by and the boy came back with sadness in his eyes. ""My life has turned so cold,"" he says, ""and I need sunny days."" ""Ive nothing but my trunk,"" he says, ""But you can cut it down And build yourself a boat and sail away."" And so he did and  Oh, the tree was happy. Oh, the tree was glad.  And after years the boy came back, both of them were old. ""I really cannot help you if you ask for another gift."" ""Im nothing but an old stump now. Im sorry but Ive nothing more to give"" ""I do not need very much now, just a quiet place to rest,""  The boy, he whispered, with a weary smile. ""Well"", said the tree, ""An old stump is still good for that."" ""Come, boy"", he said, ""Sit down, sit down and rest a while."" And so he did and  Oh, the trees was happy.  Oh, the tree was glad "

I sat in front of one particular late self portrait for some time, painted in the year before the artist died. After a while, two young men stood and quite knowledgeably discussed the painting, saying how photography never does such works justice. Then one remarked on the sadness in the face, saying that as an old man without money you would expect him to look this way, sad and regretful.... Well, I piped up, he was the same age as I am now when he painted this, and I should tell you that I see more than those things in his face, much more, but then you'd need the 63 years to understand that."

The original concept developed when I met model Fey Cody online, who told me that she had lost many people in her life and would like to do something that showed how they're spirits still lived on and were carried on within her. The result here was some spontaneous re-adaptation in the middle of the shoot while some test shots were being taken.   --  The idea of the final post-processing of the images was to have something really surreal surrounding our gorgeous model to emphasize how alone she really is.... despite everything supernatural that's happening around her.   To me, I feel that in our moments of sorrow, we focus so much on the crappyness of our lives that we fail to see that life around is actually quite beautiful and vibrant - as long as we take the time to appreciate it.   --  The starlit sky was borrowed from this magnificent website: spacespin.org/article.php/new-stars-shed-light-past   I think they really helped make the image sparkle and shine.   --  I'd like to thank and credit all the people that were involved in this shooting and that made it possible:  - Fey Cody (Main Model/Concept builder as well as the one responsible for organizing the studio rental and technical lighting team)  - Jolle Stbenne  (Designer of the dress that I had commissioned) - Joanie Lapointe (Makeup artist, Hair stylist, Airbrush artist) - Jeanine.

Nessuno ci ha visto stasera mano nella mano  mentre la notte azzurra cadeva sul mondo.  Ho visto dalla mia finestra  la festa del tramonto sui monti lontani.  A volte, come una moneta  mi si accendeva un pezzo di sole tra le mani.  Io ti ricordavo con l'anima oppressa  da quella tristezza che tu mi conosci.  Dove eri allora?  Tra quali genti?  Dicendo quali parole?  Perch mi investir tutto l'amore di colpo  quando mi sento triste e ti sento lontana?   caduto il libro che sempre si prende al crepuscolo  e come cane ferito il mantello mi si  accucciato tra i piedi.  Sempre, sempre ti allontani la sera  e vai dove il crepuscolo corre cancellando statue  --  We have lost even this twilight. No one saw us this evening hand in hand while the blue night dropped on the world.  I have seen from my window the fiesta of sunset in the distant mountain tops.  Sometimes a piece of sun  burned like a coin in my hand.  I remembered you with my soul clenched in that sadness of mine that you know.  Where were you then? Who else was there? Saying what? Why will the whole of love come on me suddenly when I am sad and feel you are far away?  The book fell that always closed at twilight and my blue sweater rolled like a hurt dog at my feet.  Always, always you recede through the evenings toward the twilight erasing statues.  -- Pablo Neruda  [Vigeland Park - Oslo - Norway]"

The work is seen as a poetic response to the individual and universal sentiments associated with emigration - sadness at leaving, but the hope of a new future in another place.

I don't know where my joy is, but it checked out when my mind became consumed with indecipherable thoughts that feel the need to work themselves out. I'm covered in a sadness and desperation that can only come from someone who needs desperately to talk to God.  I've got a lot to figure out, and the unclear future isn't exciting me but, rather, scaring the crap out of me. I need to decide what I want, I need to figure out what God wants, then I need to dump my plans, go for His, and be rested and satisfied once again.  Sigh.  Lord, my head is full.  "

Taking pictures just has not been the most important thing for me at this point, but nevertheless I will continue squeezing the shutter whenever I can.  Hopefully, we will all be able to see dramatic transformation of these areas back into their original beauty, but it is clearly a long road ahead.    If you live in the area and wish to help, please contact me and I will send you a list of volunteer centers throughout Miyagi as well as a list of important equipment to bring with you.  If you do decide to volunteer, please go with an organized group and bring the necessary equipment.  I don't mean to frighten anyone, but I was notified again today that there still are dangerous areas.  Don't go alone, please.    Here is a video that I took of the area the same day I took these pictures:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=CazswZd454o  The area that these pictures were taken, was utterly obliterated by the tsunami.  After a few hours of hauling items back and forth between my friends' destroyed home, I started to get a headache and feel sick from the fumes.  In my last post, I also mentioned that I had heard of people setting off explosions and starting fires from trying to light their cigarettes.    We worked amidst pure devastation for about 5 Hours, however we were only able to salvage a handful of their things. Sometimes it was hard to know what was theirs, since the tsunami had swept a whole city worth of belongings through the first floor of their home.  Surprisingly, the four-year-old house was in pretty good shape despite the fact that it was blown back off of its foundation about 200 feet and sat about 10-15 degrees off of level (in the video I said 60 feet, but I meant to say 60 meters.  The distance and angle is still a total guess, but you can judge for yourself in the pictures/video).  The structure of house was in such good condition, that we were able to walk up to the second floor and salvage most of the dry, smaller items.  Their daughter was just given a brand new bed and desk-set as an elementary graduation present, but we unfortunately could not take it out.     The reason we needed to go and salvage what we could as quickly as possible was because the house, although it did not look like it, was sitting in the middle of a road.  The city and self defense force had given them  only a few more days to clear out before they would have to bulldoze it down.    I asked the family if they had tsunami insurance, but apparently there is no tsunami insurance.  They will receive a small amount of money from the government, but it will not even come close to covering the damage they sustained.    The most dumbfounding part of that day for me was not surreal experience of walking through the total destruction of an entire town, but rather the laughing and smiling that came from a family who just lost everything- everything except each other.  Items and worldly possessions are of little value against the people we hold dear.  I tried to reciprocate the smiles, laughter, and healthy conversation (especially in light of the children), but it wasn't easy fighting off the grim emotions lurking below the surface.    This last weekend, I was able to volunteer for a short time in Downtown Ishinomaki and also take a few more pictures/video  The downtown area seems to be getting a lot more attention, and about half of the roads seem traversable.  Downtown also felt incredibly safe during the day time due to the dozens of police and military (both Japanese and US) walking the streets and distributing food and water at the camps.  I will post those pictures later this week.  I know my website is in shambles right now (I just have not had time), but I'm hoping to have it looking nicer as soon as possible.  I've never really sold anything from my website, but I'm going to donate all of the money I earn from ANY of the pictures I sell (not just the quake photos) to Red Cross Japan for at least the next year.  Please take it into consideration. Here is my site:  www.carstenKnoche.com  In addition, I contributed many of my pictures to QUAKEBOOK.org, and if you have never heard this organization, PLEASE check them out as well.  All of Quakebook's revenue will also go towards the Red Cross Japan.   www.quakebook.org/   Lastly, you can contribute directly to Red Cross Japan here:  www.jrc.or.jp/english/relief/l4/Vcms4_00002070.html  Thank you very much for facing this tragedy with us. With cooperation, strength, and perseverance, we can accomplish anything.  Take care, Carsten Knoche"

Dear and the Headlights.  TWLOHA, today and tomorrow.  Long story? A year ago my best friend and I had a massive fight because she couldn't stand me when I acted how I really felt. (To be fair, it's really no fun being around people who are depressed). Three months after, the two people I loved more than anything I could have imagined lied and broke my heart and turned away as I went to pieces. Those are the only three people I have ever let fully inside and each time it hurt.  It isn't the biggest of deals but it really, really got to me and there are things that I am still getting over. It took a long time to trust someone who I know loves me a great deal when trust used to come too easily, and even then as hard as i tried I couldn't be as open as was necessary. There was a block in my throat that stopped the words and forced a smile over insecurities over sadness over anything I thought would make me less enjoyable.   For the first time in almost a year, tonight I believed someone when he said he doesn't want me to pretend to be happy. I actually believe that I can just be myself and that that will maybe for once be enough. And maybe this is a mistake. But I can feel things healing inside and I haven't felt this in such a long time, like someone actually cares about me and not the front I put up. And goddamn this boy is so incredible. /Sorry for the lengthy life story. Just gettin it out.   (2/12/10)"

Ballarat's first public cemetery was recorded in 1856, when the first official cemetery burial took place on the 20th May. Local records indicate that whilst this was the first official burial, ceremonies took place in the area of the Old Ballaarat Cemetery in the late 1840's and thereafter, which was even before the discovery of gold in Ballarat and the subsequent Gold Rushes that drew people to the city from around the world.   Allow the elegant and ornate Victorian gates on the corner of Macarthur Street and Creswick Road to usher you into a world of grand and simple monuments to the dead, and to a slice of Ballarat's fantastic history.  The Old Ballaarat Cemetery is filled with historical figures from Ballarat's past as many burials were early settlers who were looking to make their fortune on the goldfields. People mentioned in my own photostream are amongst those buried here; Richard Henry Sutton of Sutton's Music Store in Sturt Street; George and Clara Crocker who dedicated windows in St Peter's Church of England to their sons who died during the Great War; Thomas Stoddart who made Ballarat a city of marble statues; and Henry Richards Caselli who designed so many beautiful and iconic Ballarat buildings.  Two important monuments in not just Ballarat's, but Australia's, history were erected in the cemetery following from the armed insurrection of 1854 - the Eureka uprising; the Eureka Diggers' Monument in 1856 and the Officers and Soldiers Monument in 1879.  Situated in the centre of the cemetery, is the original Victorian rotunda built in 1892 to the designs of James and Piper and J. C. Smith.  The Rotunda has recently been restored to its original splendour.  Cemetery records show 35,000 interments have taken place since 1856, with 18,000 prior to 1884.   Appropriately for a city, once the wealthiest in the world, because of the Gold Rushes, in 1907 gold was discovered in the Old Ballaarat Cemetery when grave diggers were preparing a grave for a Mr. T. C. Thomas.    The 1920 gatehouse building was restored in 1997."

The weather's gloomy- grey skies, opressive black clouds hanging above, like a threat, the constant, droning rain forming a percussion of melancholy on the roof and the windows.   Feeling pretty useless these days. I scrape by with the work I can get and I really do mean scrape. I have money to pay my rent- barely- but none for other somewhat essential things like food. With no sign of real employment coming any time soon, I'm going to be in trouble pretty soon.   Particularly these last few days, when i've been walking so much doing my job (I'm a student ambassador at the University, at least until they realise I graduated and shouldn't actually still be there) has left me with some truly horrific blisters which make walking really rather difficult. Fortunately I don't have much to do for the next few days except maybe go to a film roadshow tomorrow if my foot's healed up enough to be managable, so I guess I can at least rest. Just doesn't really help me feel any less useless.  I have a bunch of free time because what work I get is sporadic at best, but it never feels like my time. It feels like i'm just constantly waiting for the next few hours of work doing whatever odd jobs the University needs me for that day. It's impossible to relax and enjoy anything.  I guess you can put a lot of this down to stress, and my own addled brain, riddled as it with deep-seated psychosis', and I'm sure as soon as I land a regular gig things will brighten up.

Taking pictures just has not been the most important thing for me at this point, but nevertheless I will continue squeezing the shutter whenever I can.  Hopefully, we will all be able to see dramatic transformation of these areas back into their original beauty, but it is clearly a long road ahead.    If you live in the area and wish to help, please contact me and I will send you a list of volunteer centers throughout Miyagi as well as a list of important equipment to bring with you.  If you do decide to volunteer, please go with an organized group and bring the necessary equipment.  I don't mean to frighten anyone, but I was notified again today that there still are dangerous areas.  Don't go alone, please.    Here is a video that I took of the area the same day I took these pictures:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=CazswZd454o  The area that these pictures were taken, was utterly obliterated by the tsunami.  After a few hours of hauling items back and forth between my friends' destroyed home, I started to get a headache and feel sick from the fumes.  In my last post, I also mentioned that I had heard of people setting off explosions and starting fires from trying to light their cigarettes.    We worked amidst pure devastation for about 5 Hours, however we were only able to salvage a handful of their things. Sometimes it was hard to know what was theirs, since the tsunami had swept a whole city worth of belongings through the first floor of their home.  Surprisingly, the four-year-old house was in pretty good shape despite the fact that it was blown back off of its foundation about 200 feet and sat about 10-15 degrees off of level (in the video I said 60 feet, but I meant to say 60 meters.  The distance and angle is still a total guess, but you can judge for yourself in the pictures/video).  The structure of house was in such good condition, that we were able to walk up to the second floor and salvage most of the dry, smaller items.  Their daughter was just given a brand new bed and desk-set as an elementary graduation present, but we unfortunately could not take it out.     The reason we needed to go and salvage what we could as quickly as possible was because the house, although it did not look like it, was sitting in the middle of a road.  The city and self defense force had given them  only a few more days to clear out before they would have to bulldoze it down.    I asked the family if they had tsunami insurance, but apparently there is no tsunami insurance.  They will receive a small amount of money from the government, but it will not even come close to covering the damage they sustained.    The most dumbfounding part of that day for me was not surreal experience of walking through the total destruction of an entire town, but rather the laughing and smiling that came from a family who just lost everything- everything except each other.  Items and worldly possessions are of little value against the people we hold dear.  I tried to reciprocate the smiles, laughter, and healthy conversation (especially in light of the children), but it wasn't easy fighting off the grim emotions lurking below the surface.    This last weekend, I was able to volunteer for a short time in Downtown Ishinomaki and also take a few more pictures/video  The downtown area seems to be getting a lot more attention, and about half of the roads seem traversable.  Downtown also felt incredibly safe during the day time due to the dozens of police and military (both Japanese and US) walking the streets and distributing food and water at the camps.  I will post those pictures later this week.  I know my website is in shambles right now (I just have not had time), but I'm hoping to have it looking nicer as soon as possible.  I've never really sold anything from my website, but I'm going to donate all of the money I earn from ANY of the pictures I sell (not just the quake photos) to Red Cross Japan for at least the next year.  Please take it into consideration. Here is my site:  www.carstenKnoche.com  In addition, I contributed many of my pictures to QUAKEBOOK.org, and if you have never heard this organization, PLEASE check them out as well.  All of Quakebook's revenue will also go towards the Red Cross Japan.   www.quakebook.org/   Lastly, you can contribute directly to Red Cross Japan here:  www.jrc.or.jp/english/relief/l4/Vcms4_00002070.html  Thank you very much for facing this tragedy with us. With cooperation, strength, and perseverance, we can accomplish anything.  Take care, Carsten Knoche"

You can read a deep sadness into his eyes in this shot but... it's a joke! In fact, he simply hates to be photographed, and every time I try to do it, he turns his expression into that prying muzzle! Photo treat: black and white background to give that ""grunge"" appeal, partial desaturation of the blonde fur, increased contrast."

Long draggy post coming up ahead (and some photos in the comments)        I was with my friend last night, and he told me I apologized too much and too often which made it loose it's meaning and sincerity. I do fully agree with him on that, I suppose I'd feel the same if someone kept saying sorry to me.      I used to have a hard time saying sorry when I was younger because I was felt resentful and hateful towards people. I realized that that only made me less likable and from then on I changed it, but I can see his point, I apologize for everything, I feel guilty about everything.       I'm so afraid about hurting people's feelings, I always try to sugarcoat my words, even towards someone I dislike because I'm really scared they'll feel hurt. Sometimes when I hear people give bad comments to others like ""Omg I don't like what you're wearing, it's ugly."" ""Omg what happened to your hair, EWWWW.""  Yes it's honesty, yes I know *true friends* ""stab each other in front"" instead of at the back but a real friend would care about the other person's feelings too right? I'm sure there are better ways to phrase these kind of comments.   Maybe I'm oversensitive, I don't know why I can readily accept it when people talk like this to me, it's okay, I don't feel hurt, maybe just annoyed if it's a really rude comment. It's odd because I usually don't take offense, it's not easy to offend me. But it hurts me when I hear other people say this to their friends. Sometimes, it's inevitable that such a comment might slip out from my mouth and immediately I'm like ""Oh fuck, oh shit, I just said that.""          I think this is something I need to get over because maybe it's not such a good thing. I've been slandered, flamed, bitched about countless times, my words have been misconstrued and thrown right back in my face, I've been so so so hated by some people, they hate me so much and I do not know why because I don't even know them personally, but I don't even bother standing up for myself anymore, I just let them say what they want.    Some might say it's a mature thing to do, but some might say I'm like a pushover. Honestly, from experience ignoring someone doesn't mean they'll go away, it means they'll try harder.    "

High school began and so did staying up all night to write arguments for my Language Composition class, and waking up at the break of dawn to hand them in. It catalyzed my exhaustion, discouragement high school gave me my first taste of homesickness. But it also started bonds, independence, and my adolescent exploration of the world. September of 2011 began the rush that became my life. Now in December of 2014 the rush is slowing down. The commute is lessening; time dedicated to rest is increasing. Im learning to breathe again, absorbing more than just fragments of my experiences.  By June, this rush will have reached a halt. My photographs are tribute to the 2 cities I grew up in, and the one city that gave me my first shot at something I love.  The Escaping Moment was designed to spotlight the blur in Dayton, the lights in New York, and the faces in Chilltown Jersey City; to pay homage to the moments that made me feel small, and the ones that made me feel larger than life. Homage to every light rail ticket I purchased, and every metro card I swiped, every Friday afternoon I spent in the passengers seat of my fathers car, and every Saturday night I vaguely remember. These photographs are an expression of details I lost in my rush of a life, and the beauty of my experience without them. "

Charlatanism I appreciate all of your condolences, but it's all sad to me because I said yesterday that what I was feeling would not be expected. Grief is expected. I'm not grieving. I don't feel a loss. Our life here at home truly has continued as if nothing happened. These pictures ought to prove it.   How fucked up is that? My own family can die and I feel nothing. I was never close with him, or anyone on my dad's side of the family, for that matter. Most all of them are like him, if that tells you anything. I feel a sort of sadness for the fact that the only grandfather I knew died. And because I'm not completely malicious, of course I can be sorry for the family. But wait, I'm the family? Seems so foreign to me. I was named after the man, for crying out loud. Shouldn't I be feeling something?   And I do. I am. Feeling something, I mean. I feel sadness for the fact that this is what my family is. Distant, detached, fake. Mean.   +5 SOOC in comments. Grant took all of these. "

Although we made it out quite late, we were able to help a little by distributing water and food to a few people.  Although downtown Ishinomaki was hit very hard by the tsunami, it was very uplifting to see the progress that had already been made.  Military supply camps, squads of police, and groups of volunteers were all working tirelessly in restoration.  The downtown area seemed to be getting far more attention than any of the other areas I've visited, but rightfully so, since it has a far higher population density.    Despite the incredible progress that had been made, there is clearly still a lot to do.  The chorus of destroyed boats, cars, and houses again echoed throughout the town.  Oil-logged muck permeated through the hills of debris and toxic smells wafted through the air, but people managed to keep their spirits up regardless.   - Hide quoted text -  The most somber part of the day for me, was after we left the downtown area and made our way up to Hiyoriyama park.  I would sometimes come up to Hiyoriyama to view the cherry blossoms, watch the sunrise, or relax after archery.  Every time I went up to the park, I was stunned by the natural beauty and panoramic view of this sprawling city creeping to edge of the ocean.  This time, however, I felt as though I was punched in the gut with the starkest realization of utter destruction that I had experienced until this point.  The once beautiful view of a thriving city reaching out into the ocean, was replaced with the surreal image of toppled homes and bare foundations.  A handful of cars weaving through nearly impassable roads created the only movement in what could easily be confused with a garbage dump or wasteland.   I know that eventually the area will be restored, but it will take a lot of work and time to heal the wounds.

The first one is a reaction to practical implications relating to the loss. Sadness and regret predominate this type of depression. We worry about the costs and burial. We worry that, in our grief, we have spent less time with others that depend on us. This phase may be eased by simple clarification and reassurance. We may need a bit of helpful cooperation and a few kind words. The second type of depression is more subtle and, in a sense, perhaps more private. It is our quiet preparation to separate and to bid our loved one farewell. Sometimes all we really need is a hug."

Riga,  stata teatro i dei pi gravi scontri di piazza dal 1991, cio dai tempi delle manifestazioni per lindipendenza e della cacciata delle autorit sovietiche. Una folla composta soprattutto da giovani ha tentato un vero e proprio assalto al parlamento (Saejma) lanciando pietre, uova, petardi e chiedendo a gran voce la dissoluzione dellassemblea, le dimissioni del governo e nuove elezioni. . Lo spunto per la protesta, nata come manifestazione pacifica di molte migliaia di persone e finita poi con questi gravi disordini,  la crisi globale, che in Lettonia sta mordendo in modo estremamente grave e viene gestita da un governo completamente screditato  fatto dagli stessi partiti usciti pesantemente sconfitti nelle ultime elezioni amministrative. Il governo ha concordato con il Fondo monetario internazionale un prestito di 7,5 miliardi di euro a condizione di tagliare pesantemente le spese sociali, il che sta peggiorando in modo drammatico le conseguenze della crisi sulla popolazione. Fino a anni  fa la Lettonia era una delle economie europee con la crescita pi rapida, gonfiata da una elevata finanziarizzazione e da un boom immobiliare: ma questa corsa alla crescita ha fatto anche salire i prezzi a livelli altissimi, e quando la bolla  scoppiata,  stato un crack che ha messo in difficolt gravissime una vasta parte della popolazione. Sul disastro economico (che va di pari passo con quello di altre economie simili, come Estonia, Lituania, Ucraina) si innesta poi una componente etnico-sociale importante, visto che un terzo dei 2,3 milioni di abitanti della Lettonia sono di origine russa e molti non hanno neppure avuto la cittadinanza lettone (pur essendo nati nel paese) per via delle restrittive leggi in materia. Tra i russofoni si contano alcuni dei pi ricchi imprenditori, ma anche i ceti urbani pi disagiati e pi colpiti dalla crisi."

I can't recognize you anymore I don't even know what is worse Remember everything, like it was, when it was. Or everything, like it was, and what it turns to be  I can only think about pity So, don't ask me, if it's for me, or it's for you It comes and to cut my skull, looks like a big debt Sometimes looks deathly, but I know it's going to pass. At least I wish that everything they say in the alleys and taverns is real  From all that sadness that falls off when you open up your mouth Each one kills each part of the beautiful things that happened to us Wich probally, were just my dreams.  I don't know if I can blame you 'Cause in the deep, I know how much I was in front of your lies And see it or not, isn't a hard task But you know, the weak always choose to stay in your stupid joy Even when he knows that you're not perpetual"""

To be blinded by spotlight, the harsh reality that doesnt allow you to be lost in the unknown night, in your own secret world. A black dress, as a mourning dress to mourn life while were living it.  When I shot this picture last weekend I did it mainly because of the light. It was sunset and the golden light created long shadows that looked like living figures behind the trees. I felt that I needed to use that light in some way, and so I took this self portrait. In the editing process, I turned the whole scene into night and added in my photograph of the stars that I shot a couple of days ago. Then I started to find meaning in the black dress, the night, the stars and the light. I started to fill this picture with my own soul, with the ambivalence of life. We struggle to make it right, to find the right path. We strive. At the same time, we may feel sadness. Even if weve fulfilled all of our dreams, the wish to understand our own existence may come in the way. We cant escape the fact that our time here is limited. Still, life is so beautiful!

It's such a weird feeling that I'm going through. So many waves of ups and downs and highs and lows. I don't even know what to do with myself. I hate not talking to him cause a piece of me is broken and talking to him would make me feel better, but at the same time, talking to him would only make it more difficult. It sucks seeing everything of his on Facebook and tumblr. I hate everything about this, who wouldn't. It just makes me sad to know that it all happened so suddenly and quickly and there wasn't a substantial reason as to why it was all just done. It still hits me everyday whether this is real or not. It is and it hurts. Definitely doesn't get easier quickly. I feel different every day and don't know what tomorrow has in store for me. I miss being myself and laughing all the time. I feel like my mind is consumed by all these thoughts which are distracting me from being myself. Ughhh I want to cry again.  :( I miss him so much and I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing.

The gap between what people think of me and what I really am is covered by a lie that takes many forms and expressions. Who among us has not been forced to show interest in moments of boredom or smiled in moments of sadness? If society dictates that we have to interact in a different form than the one we are then try to find moments where we can take off the mask and relax for the lie does not become a habit so strong that we forget who we really are.

We went to visit her at the cemetary today where she is buried with her older sisters, Morgan and Bethany, who we lost before Robyn was born....it rained! Kind of approriately as that's pretty much how I feel today.....  Robyn drew her a lovely picture which I'm sure she'll enjoy wherever she is now. I'm sorry I couldn't take an equally colorful and happy photo today for her but I tried and I couldn't manage it.

It was pretty hard for me to keep a straight face. We kept on cracking up especially when there were people walking/driving pass us.   Had the camera and tripod not been there or visibly obvious... people would probably think we've gone mad. Two lads, tea cups, in the woods... lol.  Texture: credits to  skeletalmess.  Facebook"
