Experience evenings of the unexpected, perfectly paradoxical and the weird and wonderful, with extravagant entertainment and a creative mix of classic cocktails with progressive and fun elements.""  The Hilton Hotel franchise and our friends at the Zeta Bar were serious and they were back to the Coney Island theme again tonight, with a 'Statue Of Liberty' model (Victoria) for the evening's entertainment. The Statue Of Liberty in reality overlooks New York Harbour, but tonight she visited Coney Island - Zeta Bar style.  The action was all mixed with a specially concocted range of classic cocktails with a twist, like Cosmopolitan Candy Floss, Toffee Apple Martinis and Long Island Iced Tea snow cones and much, much more, with the 'Statue Of Liberty' model adding addition excitement.  The Coney Island theme was once again a huge hit and Human Statue talent will be continuing to entertain patrons at the Zeta on most Friday nights for the foreseeable future.  Very well done to everyone involved in the success of the Coney Island promotion and we're certain the titillating entertainment will keep patrons coming back for more.  It's all there for the taking at Hilton's little slice of paradise in Sydney's CBD and its you're big chance to see why 'Coney Island' is so popular the world over.  Promo...  Zeta Bar pushed the boundaries of cabaret, bringing the sexy mystique of 19th century underground back to life in Extreme Cabaret.  Extreme Cabaret was a delicious smorgasbord of fantasy and magic, wit and whimsy served with sides of lunacy and luxe, and very well lubricated with prohibition-style cocktails, mystifying molecular cocktails and delectable morsels.  About Zeta Bar...  As a progressive cocktail bar and exclusive escape in the Sydney CBD, Zeta changed the face of Sydneys bar culture when it launched as part of Hilton Sydney in 2005. Today, Zeta has won multiple awards year on year for its bartenders, playful drinks, cocktail classics and seasonal, trend setting concepts; the latest of which being Extreme Cabaret.  Access to Zeta is via glass elevator at the Hilton Sydney entrance on George Street. Zeta boasts a chic, outdoor terrace overlooking the iconic Queen Victoria Building. A VIP lounge and selection of private booths and breakout areas in luxe purple and dark wood interiors underline Zeta as the CBD cocktail bar to be seen in and part of.  An exclusive escape for visiting international celebrities too, Jessica Simpson, Kimberley Stewart, James Blunt, Snoop Dogg and Nicole Ritchie have all partied at Zeta and regular Aussie A-listers include Jennifer Hawkins, Hugh Jackman, Ian Thorpe and Megan Gale.

Even the most diehard athletes and boosters would be hard-pressed, however, to match the intensity and staying power of the fund-raising efforts backing Holmes Desmelik and Amber Rhodes.  Visit Brevard High School any day of the week to observe ""Holmes Team"" and ""Amber's Angels"" fervently chasing their goals on behalf of these fellow students.  Both Amber and Holmes suffer from cancers which cannot be fully eradicated (if at all) through surgery.  In honor of both students, Blue Devils purchased headbands for a dollar apiece, then gathered on October 9th for a star-shaped photo to honor the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation.  In the end, that first wave raised over $1,200 for the teams (see our album).  Graphics teacher Katrina Ronneburger (BHS) said, ""I wanted to help my students come up with a way they could show support for Amber Rhodes - a senior from BHS - and Holmes - whose mother Clare teaches Spanish at BHS. Both of these families have a child that's been diagnosed with a brain tumor. We came up with 'Headbands 4 Hope,' and my students jumped all over it!   ""The campaign was run through my club (BHS Graphics Club) We sold almost 100 the 1st day without any promotion. My students made posters to put all over school - and it went crazy from there.  ""Several students made generous donations and only expected one headband, others bought $20 worth to pass out to friends. We did have several anonymous donations to raise our final total to $1200.00. We donated $600 to the Desmelik family and $600 to 'Make-A-Wish' for Amber's Team.""  Clare Desmelik added, ""Thanks for showing support for our families.  Holmes was diagnosed with a tumor in his thalamus, which most doctors consider inoperable.  Right now his tumor is stable and Holmes is enjoying kindergarten. He is a great little guy with a heart of gold.  One of his goals for this year is to make a green stamp for good behavior every single day at school and not to have to get a warning from his teachers.  ""There has been an incredible amount of love and support pouring in from the community.  Our friends and Holmes' friends, many churches and small businesses have all been so generous.  I am so blessed to work in such a wonderful school system.  The folks at TCS have overwhelmed us with support.  Faculty from all of the schools have reached out, as well as the good people at the Central Office.  BHS had our back from the very first day that our world changed with his diagnosis.  The faculty, the students and their families have boosted our spirits and helped in so many ways.  The staff at BES has made Holmes feel so welcomed and Holmes sure knows his way around the high school as well!  Students and staff alike make Holmes feel like the star he is!  ""The pie challenge on October 17th is something we called 'Whipping Childhood Cancer' in order to raise awareness and send love to Amber and the Rhodes Family, as well as raise money for Make a Wish, one of Amber's favorite charities.    ""Amber's brother Garrett challenged us with this earlier this year and we of course accepted and paid it forward to 7 others, helping to raise money for the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation.  We were ready for more pies and excitement...Holmes was especially looking forward to it!""  To follow up, a group of BHS teachers have organized  ""Rent-a- Student"" to help raise money for Holmes Team to cover mounting medical bills. The registration page is located at bit.ly/rent-a-student-2014.  Holmes also has a facebook page that many in our county are already following that keeps people up to date on how things are going and of events planned.  www.facebook.com/groups/holmesteam    Honestly, we have been humbled by the love, and he Holmes Team motto is ""Love Heals.""

Don Finlay Special Tail 41 (Reserve) Squadron Tornado at RAF Coningsby Olympic and Battle of Britain Hero Commemorated  No 41 (Reserve) Squadron at RAF Coningsby have celebrated the life of a former squadron commander who was also a renowned Olympian.  Donald Finlay was Officer Commanding in the latter period of the Battle of Britain in 1940. As a pre-war athlete he had competed as a hurdler in both the 1932 & 1936 games, winning silver and bronze medals. After the war, in the London games of 1948, Finlay was the British Team Captain and was selected to take the Athletes Oath on behalf of all the other athletes competing in the games. During the Olympic opening ceremony this year this oath was taken by Sarah Stevenson, the British Taekwondo athlete. Don Finlay retired from the RAF as a Group Captain.  41 Squadron Olympic tail  The achievements of Don Finlay have been recognised by his old squadron, who have painted one of their Tornado GR4 aircraft in a distinctive tail scheme. The design incorporates the squadron symbol, the Cross of Lorraine, with an image of a hurdler. The code letters EB-Z are a reference to the Spitfire aircraft that the then Squadron Leader Don Finlay flew with the squadron. The aircraft was painted by the SERCO Surface Finish Section at RAF Lossiemouth.  Officer Commanding 41, Wing Commander Mark Rodden, said, Don Finlay had a remarkable career, both as an athlete and as a wartime leader. We are honoured to be associated with him, particularly at a time when we are sharing the excitement of the Olympics being held in our country."

Landrake Moto Parc was founded in 1995 and is set in 25 acres of beautiful Cornish countryside, with the track taking approximately half of the site - the rest for paddock area and spectator parking. We also have another 10 acres for additional parking for the very large events. The track is 1900km long and is a minimum of 10 metres wide with some sections 15 metres wide and sits in a valley with trees on one side. With features such as a whoop section, raised berms, ski-ramps, step-downs and step-ups, and a laptime of over two minutes, exhilarating racing is ensured. 40 GP-standard start gates lead you to a 110 metre start straight, turning out into a wide downhill and then a chicane - followed by a very popular feature with spectators immediately in front of the pits - a table-top suitable for laying down some whips and scrubs, with a 100 foot tabletop right after! All this with superb viewing for specatators.   Whilst the track is fast and flowing, its a very technical track, with some old-school features such as adverse cambers and natural terrain, combined with some man-made jumps, along with a rythm section to add to the excitement for riders and spectators alike.

There was personal redemption, too, for Carli Lloyd, who answered her missed kick in that 3-1 shootout loss by scoring a goal in each half to seal the Olympic crown for her nation.  Japan were dubbed the Barcelona of the women's game for their flurry of neat passing and slick movement and their average height of 5ft 4in compared to the US's 5ft 7in. The Americans were the big tournament specialists. This was the fifth women's Olympic final and USA were continuing their record of being in all of them, losing only to Norway at Sydney 2000, 3-2.  For Japan, their coach Norio Sasaki framed the attempted conquest of gold as part of the country's healing process, following the trauma of last year's earthquake which killed nearly 20,000 people.  Ahead of this final he said: ""All the Japanese people are still trying to come back from the earthquake disaster.  ""Winning the World Cup was very emotional last year and gave energy to the nation after what had happened and the same can happen again.""  After eight minutes a noisy, though not completely filled Wembley, witnessed the opening strike.

Emerging in the 90s as one of the originators of the East coast's dark cabaret movement, the band solidified its place on the scene with its junk aesthetic and operatic bravadocombining American and East European folk music to eventually win Boston's Rock and Roll Rumble in 2005.

It was a free afternoon for elementary-aged school children and their families to look at how NASA explores space and studies Earth from space using satellites and other technology.  This months Sunday Experiment explored NASAs Tracking and Data Relay Satellite project. The TDRS project at NASA Goddard is building three new Tracking and Data Relay Satellites: TDRS K, L and M. Nine TDRS spacecraft are currently in geosynchronous orbit. Together they form the space-based communication relay network known as the Space Network (SN).  The SN is made up of seven TDRS spacecraft that are responsible for relaying more than 40 different spacecrafts' data to the ground 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The TDRS constellation is responsible for gathering data from low-Earth orbiting spacecraft such as the Hubble Space Telescope, NASA's Earth-observing fleet of satellites and the International Space Station, and transmitting it to TDRS ground terminals. Once the data arrives at the ground terminals, it is sent out to the spacecrafts data processing facilities across the country. The communication also works the opposite direction with controllers on the ground using the SN to send commands like Hey, satellite, turn your camera on! to spacecraft.   TDRS K is the first of the third generation of TDRS satellites and is scheduled for launch in January 2013. This generation of TDRS will ensure that NASAs communication needs are met for many years to come.  In addition to celebrating all things science, technology, engineering and mathematics, the Sunday Experiment celebrates major science missions that are managed by NASA Goddard and set to launch in the near future. The Sunday Experiment is a place where children and adults alike can discover the excitement of Goddard through fun and engaging activities.  Sunday Experiment, held the third Sunday of each month, spotlights Goddard's world-renowned science and engineering research, and technological developments. Families leave inspired by the activities, wowed by the scientists and engineers, and excited about Goddard's revolutionary research and technology.

There was personal redemption, too, for Carli Lloyd, who answered her missed kick in that 3-1 shootout loss by scoring a goal in each half to seal the Olympic crown for her nation.  Japan were dubbed the Barcelona of the women's game for their flurry of neat passing and slick movement and their average height of 5ft 4in compared to the US's 5ft 7in. The Americans were the big tournament specialists. This was the fifth women's Olympic final and USA were continuing their record of being in all of them, losing only to Norway at Sydney 2000, 3-2.  For Japan, their coach Norio Sasaki framed the attempted conquest of gold as part of the country's healing process, following the trauma of last year's earthquake which killed nearly 20,000 people.  Ahead of this final he said: ""All the Japanese people are still trying to come back from the earthquake disaster.

I spent NYE on Granville St in Vancouver BC with two other fantastic photographers capturing the fun of the evening. We lined up side-by-side, many people thought we were with a newspaper or that we knew something really amazing was just about to take place and they asked what it was and wanted to watch too. I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over. I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol. I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.   Some of the photos might seem a bit strange with the movement/blur but I find them artistic and you can find some interesting pictures within a photo when you let yourself just look without expectations. You may also notice the odd clear face/s that paused in all the movement & excitement. All in all, everyone was having a fantastic time!!  If you see yourself in any of the pictures on my Facebook page, please tag yourself and then share the photos to your friends & family. If you like my page then you will get notified for when I post the rest of the pictures which are coming soon! www.facebook.com/AnnaHallPhotographer  Thank YOU for posing for me and bringing such great energy to NYE!!"

I spent NYE on Granville St in Vancouver BC with two other fantastic photographers capturing the fun of the evening. We lined up side-by-side, many people thought we were with a newspaper or that we knew something really amazing was just about to take place and they asked what it was and wanted to watch too. I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over. I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol. I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.   Some of the photos might seem a bit strange with the movement/blur but I find them artistic and you can find some interesting pictures within a photo when you let yourself just look without expectations. You may also notice the odd clear face/s that paused in all the movement & excitement. All in all, everyone was having a fantastic time!!  If you see yourself in any of the pictures on my Facebook page, please tag yourself and then share the photos to your friends & family. If you like my page then you will get notified for when I post the rest of the pictures which are coming soon! www.facebook.com/AnnaHallPhotographer  Thank YOU for posing for me and bringing such great energy to NYE!!"

We sailed into the harbor about 7:00 AM and as the sun came up, we woke up since our patio doors were open all night, as we enjoyed the waves and ocean breezes.  It was quite a different morning as we had some different excitement.  It looked like a small boat was trying to approach the ship, to maybe take a drop from someone on-board or something.  We watched in anticipation as a coast guard vessel moved in to stop them with the front machine gun manned and ready.  The small boat took off towards the aft end of the ship and the coast guard went in pursuit of them.  As they disappeared around the aft of the ship, more coast guard vessels came moving towards us at full speed as reinforcements.  I am sure the first boat must have caught the small boat, but then we were escorted in by the other coast guard boats still all with machine guns fully manned.  As we entered the harbor of Newport, Rhode Island, the scenery was just beautiful.  Of course, I was busy making breakfast; I mean ordering breakfast, well work is work.  What beautiful scenery this location had; which explains all the mansions built in the hills."

Stewart, Georgia-March 29, 2013)  Family fun was the well-received mandate for Soldiers of Fort Stewarts Warriors in Transition Battalion (WTB) Friday at the bases WTB Soldier Family Assistance Center (SFAC). The quarterly event, sponsored by the Ft. Stewart Army Community Services division, presented a variety of activities for families including face painting, charades, egg hunting, hula hooping and good eats; all free of charge. Our (military) families deserve to have a variety of fun options, said Linda Boitey, the centers Outreach Coordinator. The responsibility to our wounded, ill and injured Soldiers does not end with services for them; it begins at the core of what makes our Soldiers strong  their families! The games encouraged children to use critical thinking skills and team strategy development with the biggest benefit being the smiles. The non-stop action of the evening brought an unusual transformation of sorts.  The faces of the children and adults began to reveal what instinct fueled their spirit of resiliency.  Pandas, lions, comic book characters came to life with the help of WTB wife Julia Bethunes face painting.  The bright colors covered their faces but nothing could camouflage their enjoyment!  Bethune says the gift of grinning has its own healing benefits.  We are all in this together, Bethune said, cracking open another bright color to the excitement of a youngster.  You can wait for someone to bring the fun to you but sharing a laugh is what makes our family team work. (U.S. Army Photo by Staff Sgt. Tracy J. Smith) "

The Big Lunch was a simple but clever way to bring all the generations together. The children and elderly residents got to know each other better, sharing local stories and songs, and discovering the wealth of talent on our doorstep. It all helped to create a feel good atmosphere on our street. It has had a profoundly positive effect on the whole street, and we not only know who our neighbours are, but have since supported each other in times of loss.  After our second party in September we started a befriending scheme were we look out for our each others houses and elderly neighbours, and are alerted to a problem if their curtains are not open by lunchtime. A simple task which works! For this year Big Lunch', we made our own bunting, banners, and collected donations. The excitement in the run up to the party is almost as good as the day its self on our street. We are all proud to live in Portstewart and our Big Lunch celebrates the good will on our street. I would encourage anyone to give it a go as The Big Lunch team are there to help you and it doesnt need to cost much if everyone brings something to the table. Sure its fantastic fun and can make a difference in so many ways. A special thanks to. ASDA for providing their support and food, and McGee butchers for providing burgers and sausages. Halifax team for their help on the day and 150 funding.  Cool FM for the 120 hamper.

It's been a couple of years since I last visited Yosemite, and after spending the last year based in Shanghai I was champing at the bit to get back out into one of my favourite locations on the West Coast of America.  I suppose the combination of excitement and jetlag were to blame for me getting very little sleep the night before (with the long drive to and from Lake Tahoe the day before not taking it's toll as I expected it to either).  After heading out the door of my hotel in Sunnyvale around 5am, I was entering the boundary of Yosemite around 9am, too late for sunrise but early enough to beat the main flock of tourists who would decend on the park in the hours which followed.  I was rather disappointed to learn that the Glacier Point road had been closed overnight due to recent snowfall, after it being opened for around a week before my visit.  My plan of shooting half dome and it's buddies with snow caps on from Glacier Point was scuppered, so instead I made the most of my time wandering around the meadows of the valley floor, enjoying the ever-awesome view from ""tunnel view"" and the majestic scenery surrounding Mirror Lake.  You can bet your bottom dollar that I'll be back to Yosemite as soon as I possibly can be to hopefully capture some snow caps from Glacier Point (and head up to Tenaya Lake) before the park fully embraces the summer months ahead."

No fist pump. No yell of excitement. No energized jog to the sideline.     There still was work to be done; nothing to be taken for granted. Motivated by the bitter memory of quarterfinal losses at the All England Club the past two years, including a wasted two-set edge in 2011, six-time Wimbledon champion Federer bullied 26th-seeded Mikhail Youzhny of Russia 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 to reach his record 32nd career Grand Slam semifinal."

A highly intelligent animal that can subsist in virtually any habitat, but it is now being restricted by human exploitation, encroachment of nomadic routes and waterholes. Elephants are highly sociable and have similar life cycles to humans. The maternity herd is very protective of young, but males are ejected at 12-15 years old, after which they become nomadic males, often associating with other males. Males tend to have thicker tusks and more rounded foreheads than the females who have thinner tusks and more square shaped foreheads.   Elephants have to eat 5% of their body weight every day and so sleep for only 4-5 hours a day and in very short bursts (often whilst standing!). They communicate through subsonic calls that humans are unable to detect and Elephants may detect these even kms away, feeling vibrations in their feet also. Deceptively quick, able to reach 30kms/h they are often seen hustling to waterholes that sate their thirst (can drink up to 200 litres in one drinking session!).  Estrus lasts 2-6 days and females typically first mate between 8-20 years old. After a gestation period of about 22-24 months, one calf is born under great excitement within the herd; Elephants have strong bonds and even at 9yrs old a calf may spend over half of the time less than 5metres away from it mother. The story of Elephant graveyards is a myth and old elephants tend to congregate where plants are soft and moist, because their last molars (Elephants have 6 molar sets in their lifetime) have worn down and they start to lose condition in their sixties.  Calves are nursed for 1-2 year, up to 4 but they take at least a few weeks to learn how to use their trunks.  Elephants can be seen throughout the Maasai Mara, but when the large numbers of wildebeest take over the savannah, the elephants are pushed into the Crotons and woodlands where they cause a lot of damage.

I spent NYE on Granville St in Vancouver BC with two other fantastic photographers capturing the fun of the evening. We lined up side-by-side, many people thought we were with a newspaper or that we knew something really amazing was just about to take place and they asked what it was and wanted to watch too. I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over. I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol. I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.   Some of the photos might seem a bit strange with the movement/blur but I find them artistic and you can find some interesting pictures within a photo when you let yourself just look without expectations. You may also notice the odd clear face/s that paused in all the movement & excitement. All in all, everyone was having a fantastic time!!

I spent NYE on Granville St in Vancouver BC with two other fantastic photographers capturing the fun of the evening. We lined up side-by-side, many people thought we were with a newspaper or that we knew something really amazing was just about to take place and they asked what it was and wanted to watch too. I chose for us to stand behind street barricades on Granville St as a means to help control foot traffic from knocking us or our cameras over. I had one really close call....when the group of guys decided to pick one of the barricades up and toss it around. I moved pretty darn quick out of the way! That was a good decision!    Later on in the evening, after the NYE countdown, we placed ourselves, still on Granville St, between The Roxy & The Caprice bars so lots of people hanging about there.  It amazes me how fast you move around! I had my camera on super high ISO and on a tripod so a lot of the photos have some blur....or a lot lol. I left the majority of the photos, clear or not as some people will be able to see themselves through the blur.   Some of the photos might seem a bit strange with the movement/blur but I find them artistic and you can find some interesting pictures within a photo when you let yourself just look without expectations. You may also notice the odd clear face/s that paused in all the movement & excitement. All in all, everyone was having a fantastic time!!  If you see yourself in any of the pictures on my Facebook page, please tag yourself and then share the photos to your friends & family. If you like my page then you will get notified for when I post the rest of the pictures which are coming soon! www.facebook.com/AnnaHallPhotographer  Thank YOU for posing for me and bringing such great energy to NYE!!"

It was very exciting to have all of our Willows family members join us for our visiting day. We hope you had as much fun as we did.  While the temperature outside continued to rise, so did the fun and excitement. All the children had plenty of water breaks and extra time swimming to keep cool. Even the threat of rain didnt dampen our spirits. We had the opportunity to have an extra special snack of sandwich cookies decorated with icing and jimmies.  This weeks theme was Finding Nemo, and the Tadpoles and Minnows created CD fish door hangers in Camper Creations. At Ceramics, the campers enjoyed painting their clay hands and feet. All your childrens projects will be sent home shortly. On Wednesday, in preparation for Waterworld and to honor our weekly theme of Finding Nemo, many of our Tadpoles and Minnows attempted the giant water slide and loved it.  To end our wonderful week, The Willows campers joined the rest of camp at Waterworld. The children drove water boats and joined in other great water activities. A terrific time was had by all!  We are looking forward to the next four weeks with your children. As a reminder, please remember to label all items brought to camp and wear yellow as much as possible.  About Willow Grove Day Camp Willow Grove Day Camp provides summer fun for kids who live in Willow Grove, Abington, Blue Bell, Hatboro, Horsham, Huntingdon Valley, Lafayette Hill, Philadelphia, Plymouth Meeting, Southampton and the surrounding areas.

Landrake Moto Parc was founded in 1995 and is set in 25 acres of beautiful Cornish countryside, with the track taking approximately half of the site - the rest for paddock area and spectator parking. We also have another 10 acres for additional parking for the very large events. The track is 1900km long and is a minimum of 10 metres wide with some sections 15 metres wide and sits in a valley with trees on one side. With features such as a whoop section, raised berms, ski-ramps, step-downs and step-ups, and a laptime of over two minutes, exhilarating racing is ensured. 40 GP-standard start gates lead you to a 110 metre start straight, turning out into a wide downhill and then a chicane - followed by a very popular feature with spectators immediately in front of the pits - a table-top suitable for laying down some whips and scrubs, with a 100 foot tabletop right after! All this with superb viewing for specatators.   Whilst the track is fast and flowing, its a very technical track, with some old-school features such as adverse cambers and natural terrain, combined with some man-made jumps, along with a rythm section to add to the excitement for riders and spectators alike.
