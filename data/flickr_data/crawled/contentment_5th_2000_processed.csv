Up to the age of 10, Karen Jackson, now 29, describes her childhood in Berkshire as a ""normal, typical kid's life."" She adds, matter-of-factly, ""But from the ages of 11-16, my life was hell.""  Adolescence is usually a turbulent time, but for Karen it marked the end of her childhood contentment altogether. Growing up as the only girl with two older brothers, Karen was often made to feel unwanted because she was a girl.  ""My parents told me I was a mistake,"" she says, ""But I just wanted to feel loved and accepted.""  She lists the habits that drove her out of control: ""Drink, drugs, nicking stuff, fighting"" In her own words, she was ""an angry young person.""  Just after she turned 16, Karen was kicked out of her home by her mother, leaving her to sleep underneath blocks of fats, garages, and occasionally her friends' floors. She got drunk most nights, whenever she could get hold of some alcohol.  A year later, having lived in foster care, Karen had to ""move on"" because her foster parents couldn't deal with her drink and drug habits. ""I couldn't settle anywhere,"" explains Karen, ""with my foster parents, I felt like a lodger rather than part of the family.""   At 21, Karen had nothing to keep her in Berkshire. After a failed attempt to ""live the dream"" in Tenerife, she ended up sleeping on a friend's floor in Leicester.  Months later, she managed to get a room at an outreach hostel. A girl living there invited Karen to her first church meeting, a ""friendship meal"" at a Jesus Fellowship community house called ""Springfield"".  ""Afterwards,"" she chuckles, ""I decided I never wanted to go back. But I did start a relationship with one of the guys I met there.""  Two months later, Karen found herself asking her Christian boyfriend and his friend questions about God. ""I claimed God was nothing to me,"" says Karen, ""But I didn't know that the Holy Spirit was working in me.""  It wasn't the first time she had sensed that there ""might be more to life"". The week before she started asking her boyfriend aboutGod, she had experienced a peaceful sensation go through her body. ""I knew there was someone else in the room, even though I could see there wasn't.""  Days later, she started to have a panic attack in her bedroom in the hostel and asked a friendfor help. He phoned a member of staff, a Christian woman who sat on the end of Karen's bed and said, ""I'll call the ambulance, but, before I do can I pray for you?"" She put her hand on Karen's shoulder and prayed. A few seconds later, she was breathing normally.  Some time later on the way to a residents meeting at the hostel, Karen suddenly started to skip and dance around the local park. She returned to the hostel and announced to her friend: ""I think it's time!"" Karen defines it as the Holy Spirit's energy filling her. Minutes later, she had the urge to open her mouth and shout ""Jesus Christ is Lord!"" She realised that this was a sign that she had real faith. For the next few hours, the Holy Spirit bubbled up inside her. Karen couldn't stop laughing.  Later, a Christian member of staff visited Karen and found her full of enthusiasm. ""Julian, I'm a Christian! I love Jesus!"" He was amazed at the change, informing her that she'd ""gone from ice cold to boiling hot"".  The following day, Karen returned to ""Springfield"" and in January 2004, she was baptised as a Christian, knowing it was a step she needed to make. She says: ""At times when things have been tough, and I've felt like clearing off, God's reminded me of my baptism and it's held me true.""  Eight years on, Karen's life has changed dramatically. She hasn't drunk any alcohol for six years, hasn't smoked for over seven years and has known a lot of healing.  ""I've been able to accept myself, through knowing that God loves me and my friends in the church love me.""  She talks excitedly of ""First Spring"", a group for teenage girls in Leicester that she leads, along with a few others. ""It's a space where the girls can relax, make friends and find life.""  ""God touched me so deeply that I can never walk away from Him. I've come so far since my teenage years; I'm a lot calmer and happier. I'm a daughter of God, and proud of it!""  www.jesus.org.uk/ja/mag_jcml201289_booze.shtml"

I chose this image as it encompasses the barren state of our family farm during the drought, yet the beauty of natural disasters.  Describe the circumstances of the photograph, and what you tried to achieve with the image. This photo was taken shortly after the fires of black Saturday during the 2009 drought. I took this photo in a series to highlight the changes in colour and tone that occurs after extended periods of heat and dry weather. The added smoke dramatises the image, and is an indicator of how difficult these times were.    What you thought of Amy Toensings photo of Doug & Harry I thought the image was quite beautiful due to the lighting and the way in which the image is symmetrically balanced. However, it wasnt until Amy Toensing began describing the two men and their living circumstances that I could truly appreciate the image and what it represented. Your opinion as to why the photo editor did not like Amys photo The photo editor would not have been able to fully understand the meaning of the photograph as, without the story behind the two men, it is difficult to grasp the beauty of Doug and Harrys living arrangements and therefore the image itself. What did the photograph convey about the lives of the two brothers particularly in reference to Amys story that she related to us Viewing the image alone the two men can appear quite strange, and perhaps lonely (not experiencing the usual marriage, children and so on), however teamed with Amy Toensings stories of Doug and Harry generates a form of contentment the men share with their living circumstances due to the company of each other.  How did the formal elements of the picture contribute to the emotional elements within the picture? The formal elements, such as the soft lighting and warm colours seem to contribute to the innocent nature of the two men, and perhaps highlight a sense of calm and contentment they share within their living arrangements.

Kensett chose an unusually wide format for the small painting and provided no framing devices to mark the edges of the composition.  Showing extreme sensitivity to gradations of tone, he applied broad areas of pure color interrupted only by subtle brushstrokes, such as those representing four diagonal reeds or markers in the left half of the canvas, a rowboat in the foreground, a tiny island, several white sailboats, and a very slight white wave or reflection on the otherwise placid surface of the water.

Her expression feels very sincere and appears to come from an inner state of peace and contentment, and I feel a connection to that as a viewer.  I worried that the background may be a bit busy given the large amount of space it occupies, and even now it could probably do with fewer lines.

This Sunday's readings are all about searching for the kingdom of heaven and finding that it's right in plain sight. Solomon, the wisest man who ever lived, knew that. When God invited him to ask for anything at all, Solomon asked for the gift of wisdomand God gave it to him. Later in life, he foolishly let wisdom slip through his fingers, and so his kingdom split apart.  So, what's so great about wisdom? Wisdom shows us what is really important in life, and what is worth living and dying for, and what is not.  In a couple of weeks, I'll have the privilege of being at a celebration of the Jubilees for the Sisters of St. Joseph in Watertown. What wisdom those consecrated nuns had in choosing to pursue the Kingdom of God from their teenage years all the way to the present! And how happy and fulfilled those sisters arethey have found love in the love of their Spouse, Jesus. They are surrounded by care and attention in their later years, and they have the assurance of a heavenly reward when God calls them home. They are wise virgins, indeed!  The kingdom of heaven is like a pearl of great price, a treasure hidden in a field, a net full of fish! And each one of us in every time and place are meant to fill in the blanks. Treasure is doing something important with my life, doing something that will help others, finding happiness and contentment. And there it isthe kingdom of heaven is right here and now, staring me in the face, challenging me to take possession now.  - Msgr.

The woman who found her called around, but nobody locally was missing a calf. The sheriffs department and the local animal control offered to take Aggie and sell her for slaughter, but the caring woman refused and decided to instead keep Aggie until she was tame enough to get onto a trailer. After feeding and caring for her for a few months she became a little more trusting, and in December 2011 we were able to pick her up and bring her to Poplar Spring. She is a very sweet and lively cow who will now be able to happily live out the rest of her life in peace and contentment.  Aggie spends most of her day grazing on grass on the 400 acres of pasture. Her best friend is Nellie, another young cow who is just a few years older. The two of them buck and run and play together and Nellie is often seen grooming Aggie. Their main diet is grass and hay, with a little sweet feed given twice a day. Apples and bananas are Aggies favorite treats. From Poplar Spring Animal Sanctuary's website."

We stopped at the Rockefeller Chapel along the way. It was such a wonderful time shooting and spending time with these wonderful photographers. I think we all did as much talking as we did shooting and ended the day with a great lunch. Thanks to Jim Watkins for organizing the walk and for his hospitality.   Viewminder made it, despite recovering from hand surgery (thank goodness it wasn't his shutter finger!) and here he is sitting in the best seat in the house. I had no idea that he was taking my picture (see the second one in the comments), while I was shooting this one! That's one of the things that makes him such a great street photographer!  The weekend flew by way too quickly. I need to remember to shoot my selfie when I'm out shooting other things over the weekend. I had the opportunity on Saturday as well as yesterday and now I'm down to the wire and I either have to do it in between raindrops or setup some lighting at home tonight. One of these days I may learn.  Have a great week!  "

We arrived Friday evening and set up our campsite. We had something to eat and then went out and got some firewood. On the way back, we stopped at the boat launch in the campground. We set up chairs and my camera to wait to get some shots of the moon. We sat and watched the stars for a long time. I had wanted to try doing some star trails, but found that the moon (at full that night) was far too bright. I wasn't even able to see all of the stars of major constellations, much less a lot of minor stars in the sky. So, we watched anyway and I pointed out all the constellations that I knew, then got out my StarWalk app on my phone and we found a few more. The moon was taking forever to rise above the tall tree line so we packed up and headed out to the park entrance where we were able to see it. So we parked and setup right there and got some shots.     This was a pretty spur-of-the-moment trip as I had just planned it a couple of weeks ago. We covered almost 1100 miles over the four days and saw a lot. And the weather couldn't have been better. Wonderful temperatures, clear skies and no bugs to speak of at all. We were able to spend so much one-on-one time together!  This is Grand Portal Point, approximately in the middle of our 10+ mile hike that we took on Saturday. It was a big circle loop that went from the tailhead out to Chapel Rock on the lakeshore, then down the coast past Grand Portal Point down to Mosquito Beach and Mosquito Falls, then back to the trailhead. It was a beautiful hike through the woods, then along the sandy coast.    245/366   (uncropped version in the comments)     "

Hungry to touch the love of my soul. Wanting to know the One who can make me whole. A walk in the park to meet my Beloved. The day moves by so slow, every hour is coveted. I long to hear the voice of the lark,  As I long for the walk in the park. A voice so sweet the melody sings,  As a tender enchanting dream. The voice heals and beckons me on. Bringing me inner joy and contentment,  As I am filled with a song. A walk in the park with the one I call Lord. A walk in the park with the One I adore.  I desire this moment away But even within the spirit I can find this escape. I close my eyes and I am with Him. I am walking on a narrow road over the glen. Each moment away in this secrete place Is a sacred gem that I find in Him. A walk in the park is only a prayer. I can connect to the Maker above,  And He can lead me into oceans of love. A walk in the park with the King of my heart I am lifted away to a majestic escape And returned with unspeakable joy And love to embrace.   Laura Hull "

The sound wasnt loud, and it wasnt too near, But I opened my eyes when it tickled my ear. Perhaps just a cough, I didnt quite know, Then the sure sound of footsteps outside in the snow.

John Frederick Kensett       American   1816-1872 Detail from: Passing Off of the Storm ,   1872 Oil on canvas Inspired by his view from Contentment Island, near Darien, Connecticut,  Passing Off of the Storm  is a masterful example of the artists series known as his Last Summers Work.  Kensett chose an unusually wide format for the small painting and provided no framing devices to mark the edges of the composition.  Showing extreme sensitivity to gradations of tone, he applied broad areas of pure color interrupted only by subtle brushstrokes, such as those representing four diagonal reeds or markers in the left half of the canvas, a rowboat in the foreground, a tiny island, several white sailboats, and a very slight white wave or reflection on the otherwise placid surface of the water.

New days full of eager audiences waiting in breathless anticipation, the bleachers are always full.  Popcorn and cotton candy in the bellies of happy children.  But the arena is empty and the air is stifled with the thick blanket of indifference.  The soil stained with the blood of old soldiers, ghosts of the soulless regime. Intoxicating viewpoints, seducing entire civilizations.  Fallen Angels laughing at collective religious ignorance.Working, striving, accelerating, trying to keep up.  Thank God for the fire, the warmness and contentment.  Images of light coming to meet me.  A happy reunion, a friend long lost, victims of bad timing.  Lonely travels down the forlorn path Antecedents reminding me of how I could have done it better.  For the only way out is up and the only way up is through the fire.  Redwood trees and granite lead the way though it hardly seems real.  Watching in hiding, listening to the maddening sound of their voices singing through the air, shrill and hollow.  Singing a song about me.  Dancing naked knee deep in my blood.  Ruthless killers couldnt do better this,  though that is of little comfort now. Biting at the heels of contentment, Energy made manifest, seems like matter has betrayed universal law  Im not really sure what that means.  Probably nothing of consequence. Generations lamentations, devastations, spasmodic earth ever changing, rearranging, decks of cards not in order.  Chaotic scrimmages fighting against an invisible enemy steadily marching forward, never looking back.  Steady streams of malcontent effortlessly winding down the forlorn path.  Writhing under the pressure of time, withering bloody corpses of yesterday, today, tomorrow.  Existence as we know it ceases without warning, followed by evolutions, revolutions, new species doomed to repeat our past.  "

The sun shone and Peanut went blackberry picking and I realised we did the exact same thing on Bank Holiday Monday in August 2007. The very first picture I took, almost as soon as I got out of the car was this one and for me it was the best from the day. Probably it has a lot to do with my recent health worries but I was struck by the poignancy of this shot and my first thought was I hope that one day that is me and Peanut, old, happy, together and in love. We'll do our best anyway.   Hope your day was as good as this.   Groovy word of the day: contentment"

Today it reminds me about how vulnerable I am without His love.  Whatever obstacle I faced, it should never compromised my loves towards Him. Because it will always be for my own good and He knows better than I do =)   By Allahs Mercy, accepting what He decrees with patience for us is a route to salvation, but it is a higher degree for us to embrace and love that decree. By another inspiring aspect of Allahs guidance, the latter is initially harder but actually makes the path toward Him easier. Instead of religion just being a set of duties or things we have to put up with, it becomes an on-going source of wonder and contentment. May Allah grant us the state of being contented with His Decree."

The guy lived in Kent, England and in somewhat close proximity to Winston Churchill's estate, i believe. hence the name.  he's been here for a few years now, though.  one thing about me: if i see a dog, a cat, a snake, or anything that is a pet by any stretch of the imagination, while out and about, i am compelled to try pet it and fall a little bit in love as much as possible without being seen as creepy.  another thing about me: i talk to strangers. a lot. i don't embarrass easily. and i'm very talkative and love meeting people. even if for a few minutes. my shy-ish husband is not the biggest fan of this aspect of my personality.   and if i happen to meet someone from the UK, it becomes a personal goal for the next few minutes to decipher where EXACTLY they're from, without them telling me but with a few questions, or just making them speak and trying to decipher the dialect and pin it on a city. it's a fun game for me. probably not so much for them. but i'm like, this ridiculous, sort of sad little Anglophile and it makes me happy. and my enthusiasm tends to carry me into the ""endearing"" fold instead of ""annoying"" fold more often than not.  so, put English boy, who, though not from the North (my fave), but also not from London - so bonus points, in my path, paired with a dog, make English boy cute and have a ridiculously stylish girlfriend with him who's also sweet, and clearly we're instant BFFFF's.   this is at a little coffee shop down the street from me on Melrose Ave. i ADORE this wall. it's painted this dark red and cracked and texture-y all on it's own. i have another picture that i used this wall in. sort of by accident (see comments). had my camera with me. a super old point and shoot and i asked if i could take a picture. he assumed i meant Just Dog, but i said, i wanted him too. and his girlfriend. and the dog. they were fun. and interesting. why not?   so he thought it best to pick up Winston and cuddle him for the duration of the few photos i snapped. out of all of them, this was the a cute little moment not exactly meant for the camera, so i liked it best.  he's nuzzling Winston and Winston LOVES it. seriously. that's just unreal contentment on that dogs face.

This is the way we were meant to be.   We are not perfect, but there is beauty in our being in spite of our imperfection. We are not whole, but He makes us whole.

You ever had an idea you were compelled to see through, but couldn't explain why?  This was one of those times.  As much as I enjoy group shoots, I also love shooting alone.  I have more smiles when I'm out with friends, but there's something so very fulfilling to my soul when I'm out alone.  This was the last composition of a four hour shoot.  Afterward, while chewing on a tasty Luna Bar, watersoaked up to my thighs, and camera still on its tripod, I looked around, smiled, and thought, ""I'm completely content.""  I had set aside more than enough time to shoot there, had no obligations, and felt free.  I send this smile out to you."

I'm not sure how you found my kitten pics or why you posted them, but here's an answer to the question that hmonkey posted in the thread:  First of all, I'm not sure how you (hmonkey) came by the assertion that this is a filthy, cluttered house. It's actually a lovely, old, well-preserved prewar apartment in a great location. Most of the pics I have up of my apartment are either the ones I just posted last weekend from before I moved in, where it's EMPTY, or ones that I posted while in the process of moving and unpacking, when *everything* is going to look filthy and cluttered. I can assure you that it's currently neither filthy nor cluttered, thankyouverymuch.   And yeah, that is craft paper and blue painter's tape, because I've lived here for less than a month, the previous (asshole) tenants stole the blinds, the (old and didn't really think things through) landlord didn't notice, and I can't afford curtains right now. My bedroom is at the back of the house and gets direct afternoon sunlight. It's Sacramento. It's summertime. It gets f*cking hot, and the best way to cut down on my A/C usage and keep my bedroom at a decent temperature is to tinfoil and paper up the windows. Ghetto? Yeah, but it's going to have to do until next month when I can afford curtains. So get a life already. I have no debt because I'm patient and save for things--how about you?"

All rights reserved.  took this photo with a Nikon D700. Nice camera, very capable. But it has a design defect regarding some simple parts.  Here's my ""peeling grip"" story. My D700 is 9 months old, bought in the US (my permanent home) and delivered there when I was home last winter. I live and work full-time outside the US.  For 8 months, the rubber grips were fine. Then all of a sudden, 2 of them lifted off the camera and now are loose over about 3/4 of their area. They'll stick back down if I press on them, but that lasts only for a couple of hours.  I wrote to Nikon USA, told them I couldn't send the camera in for warranty repair because I'm overseas and the cost of shipping would be $350 per DHL. I requested that Nikon simply send me replacement grips (which have the double-sided adhesive attached) and I'd do the replacement.  Nikon's response: spend the money and ship the camera to Melville NY. They wrote that it's not possible for Nikon to send the grip panels to me under any circumstances.  My response is simple: they're nuts.  My next response? Other companies make nice cameras too, even though 40+ years of Nikon use is hard to forget. I'll learn to live without my Nikons over time.  But it's also hard to believe that a company is so inflexible, and cares so little for its customers. That sort of corporate behavior is what led to the bankruptcy of the US auto industry; it's remarkable that Nikon has chosen that sorry example as its role model. "

I guess the easiest one is ""Thank God the sunrise was so gorgeous this morning!"" And then there's ""I did it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""  For the record, I'm not a morning person.  I've been jealous of the West Coasters who get all the gorgeous sunsets... so I bit the bullet and got up at 5:30 am to make the 30 minute trek to the beach :oD    I really don't want to leave you with a speech, I think I've said it all at some point. Thank you all.  First the 365November08 group and then all of my other faithful flickr friends who have helped carry me through this monster of a project.  It started on a whim, and ends with a huge sigh of relief and contentment. When I began I knew virtually nothing about photography, now I feel like I at least have some of the basics as a framework to build on.  A few simple stats (because everyone seems to do this??  Peer pressure?? ugh...) And these are according to Flickr, not ME!  Most interesting - ""The Bored Room""  Which did NOT make Explore... oh the Irony! Most views, top three - Day 323 ""Shutter"", Day 14 ""The Other Side of Trubble"" and day 60 ""16 Things""  There were 22 that made Explore (which, again, were usually not the ones I would have chosen!)  One of which hit front page, Day 323 ""Shutter"". (link above :oP)  I had a lot of personal favorites, but I won't bore you ;o)  I think ""The Bored Room"" and this one would be near the top though.    I'm going to take a break from projects until next year.  I'll be here pretty much as usual though... just without the SP's!  I'll be getting a new wide angle lens this month, YaY!  And I'm going to the Bahamas next month, double YaY!!    I'll end with something you've heard before and will hear again... I'm working today, I'll catch up with you peeps as soon as I can :o)  "

Today, Max and I picked up a new puppy. We're raising it to be a service dog for people with disabilities. So, this 365 will likely be full of dozens of photos of Orent, the wonderful yellow lab we are raising for  Canine Companions for Independence. Undoubtedly, some will be of the messes he makes or chaos he causes! It will be fun to look back after he's gone on to be a service dog, and have photos of him as he grew up with us.   But this 365 project won't just be about Orent, I promise! Just like last time, you can expect photos of demonstrations I'm organizing with my new job as the Director of Casino-Free Philadelphia, or training sessions that I coordinate with my other job working for Training for Change.   You'll also see more efforts at some ""classic"" (some might say cliched) shots that  I never got around to last time around. And I'm hoping to rely heavily on my iPhone whenever possible, because the things that camera can do are pretty amazing and I'd love to use this project to learn more about the abilities of my ""everywhere"" camera.   So follow along on this exciting year... it's going to be a blast!  This time last year, a giant tree had fallen down.  PS - Because it's fun, I'm going to use this for the Monthly Scavenger Hunt item ""Contentment""."

contentment,http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4113/5052472574_bc2ddb9365_z.jpg,0,5,"Love B&W Susan (Tiger Lair) started the group, ""Tigger The Gatekeeper's Garden Clubhouse"" several years ago after ""meeting"" this gorgeous, orange tabby when he lived at Sugar Mill Gardens, and was for all intents and purposes, the unofficial mascot. It was through her that I learned of Tigger, and on January 1, 2008, went to the gardens for the first time to meet him for myself. I knew that Susan would be out of town that day, and the temps were dropping down to 26 degrees that night, which is very unusual for our area. With no one to check on Tigger, and since I'd already become a member of his group, I decided to run by and see if he had anyplace to go where he could stay warm, not knowing if he'd ever been outside in weather that cold or not before.   when I got there, the temp was already about 40 degrees, and when I found Tig, he was lying on top of the old ruins, trying to sun himself to stay warm, but already shivering. I'd brought a big, pink blanket with me for him, so I tossed it over the chain link fence, on top of the ruin's wall, so he could get on it. He looked at me suspiciously, so I walked away, taking pics as I went, and noticing that the bushes were covered to keep them from freezing, but Tigger seemed to have no bedding or building to go in to keep warm. When I returned from my walk, I found Tigger on top of the blanket, looking very happy! I knew Susan would bring him treats, which I did, too, so I asked him if he wanted them, and he came over the fence to eat them.   The rest is history. From that moment on, I fell in love with Tigger! I went to the gardens at least twice a week, and as time went on, every day. It became obvious to me that he was an older cat, and the outdoor life was no longer agreeing with him. I already had two cats, so I didn't plan on taking Tigger in, but that's how things ended up.   In August of 2008, a major tropical storm was headed our way. Knowing that Tigger had no shelter that would really protect him from that kind of weather, and that there would be no way to get to him were the storm to intensify, at the last minute, I grabbed my cat carrier, and got there just as they were lockiing the gates to leave him there during the storm, with a bowl of food and a prayer. I grabbed him and brought him home, where he promptly let it be known that he loved my bed, and I wasn't allowed to move or disturb him or I'd get a ""gentle"" but not so subtle claw touching my leg to warn me not to move! He has slept with me ever since, and though he sometimes stares longingly out the windows of my house, and has gotten out twice, (only for a couple of minutes,) he seems very happy and content not to deal with mosquitos, fleas, ticks, or raccoons, not to mention rain and foul weather.   Today, Susan came, as she does about every month or so, and brought not just Tigger, but ALL my kitties, food, tuna, and litter, because she knows I can't afford to care for them right now. Two years ago, I lost my job of 16 years, and right after that, my mother died. After 14 months of unemployment, I finally landed a part time job at a used furniture store. I do odd jobs as I can, but can only count on about $600 a month coming in. I don't have a budget that allows me to buy groceries for myself, let alone the cats, and I've gone into debt, and gone without food for up to a week to feed them. So Susan, seeing that need, has continued to help us regularly, sometimes even giving me a gift card so that I can eat, too! Mostly, I live on bread that I get free from my church. Whenever she comes, it is such a blessing, and I am blown away by her love and devotion to me and my pets.   Here's the thing that makes it even more amazing. Susan is allergic to cats! Whenever this poor woman visits, she ends up with her eyes itching, and sealing shut, and sometimes even breaks out in hives! Still, she loves Tigger, Squeegee, and Barrymore, (and I think also her friend- ME!) so much that she comes anyway, and here you can see that she's loved in return. My cats know her by name now, and when I tell them she's coming, they get all excited, and even start feuding to gain position, to see who gets to be near her, and pet first! Today, Barrymore, and Tigger sparred, and Barrymore claimed the ottoman so Susan would pet him. This is pretty neat, because he usually keeps his distance from people. He let her pet him for quite a while, and Tigger was furious, and very jealous and quite vocal about the whole thing! So Susan had to move across the room, where Tigger could have her all to himself! Here you can see how happy and contented he was to have his other Mom petting him.   To learn more about Tigger and his illustrious past, which really is quite interesting, visit my set, ""All for Tigger"". There you will see my first photos of him on his pink blanket, and see him in Sugar Mill Gardens. You can also see his pics from when he first came to my home, and how comfy he was from the get-go!   Anyone who has been following Tigger's story and who wants to help out with his (or his brother's) vet care, please contact me. My kitties are all seniors now, and eventually, will need more care than I can afford to give them now. It's a sad state of affairs these days, and I never figured things would be this tough for this long, but I've made a commitment to my furry charges to care for them for the rest of their little lives, and am not above asking for help to do that. They, unlike us, can't understand why they hurt, or why there's not enough food. Fortunately, Susan has made sure they haven't gone hungry for a long time, but I'd like to ease her burden a bit, too. So, if you can help, I'd be grateful.   I will be posting more pics from this visit and afterwards, when the boys were all worn out from vying for attention!   Thanks again, Susan, for doing so much for us for so long! God willing, things will improve soon, and you can just visit empty handed!"

When I  first got there, I walked along the north side of the planetarium and ran into some people from a photography club who were very nice. They were setting up their tripods, planning to do panos of the skyline. Several of them had these cool little levelers that I just added to my Amazon wish list for when I need to get my order up to $25 for free shipping! ;)  Since they were waiting for the sun to go down to really get started, and I hadn't walked around the planetarium in years, I packed up my things and headed off.   It's an eastern view out to the lake, but the setting sun spread its warm colors around and I got some shots of a beautiful sailboat as it was slowly and gracefully heading south. As I headed around to the south side of the building, there is a small inlet and beach. These two kids had just gotten in the water and they walked out to where you see them here. The air was very chilly, I was wearing gloves and a warm jacket and could hardly stand the thought of how cold I would be if I were them. They were throwing rocks out into the lake and I kept shooting and waited for them to do something that would look nice in silhouette. I finally got tired of waiting for them and I shouted out to them and asked if they would hold hands for a picture! Luckily they obliged for a minute while I got off a few quick shots. I don't think that they were boyfriend and girlfriend and, rather, just friends. I thanked them when they got our of the water and showed them the shots.  I made my way back around to the people from the photo club that I had met earlier and setup again. I don't think I got any shots to be excited about. I also discovered that my sensor is incredibly dirty and the muck is just further enhanced when doing long exposure. As soon as it got so dark that long expo was my only option, I headed home for the night.  Special shout-out to Flickr_Rick. I got to talk to him yesterday as we are trying to resolve our issues with our Pocket Wizards. It was great to talk to you, Rick! Thanks for including me trying to resolve this, it's been a thorn in my side since last year when I got them!  Since it's Sliders Sunday, I played around with this shot both in Lightroom and CS5 until I got it just so! Enjoy the rest of the weekend, it'll be Monday morning before we know it! HSS!!      "

Shops for pain, sorrow, bitterness and heartbreak Shop around - it's not to late. Shops for joy, happiness, contentment, devotion Shops for every emotion.  Stop in - look around - feel every emotion That can be found. Shop around ahead of time To find out what awaits down the line.  But do not be fearful of pains That may await Take the chance - don't hesitate.  You can search every shop that's on this street But there is nothing that can compete To the love that you have deep inside A love so beautiful that you can not hide  All these shops are in your soul Open the doors and life unfolds.  - Louis Ram - ------------------------ Powered by Canon EOS 500D Flick @ www.flickr.com/photos/huynguyen_channel for better quality image Copyright  2014 Huy Nguyen.

Text Appearing Before Image: aring he would breakhis little puppy teeth, or possibly die from franticand persistent efforts to be free, I concluded torelease him from the cabin. My fears that hewould run away if left free were groundless. Hemade his way to my saddle, which lay on theground near by, crawled under it, turned roundbeneath it, and thrust his little head from be-neath the arch of the horn and lay down with alook of contentment, and also with an air whichsaid, I 11 take care of this saddle. I d like tosee any one touch it. And watch it he did. At midnight a cowboycame to my camp-fire. He had been thrown fromhis bronco and was making back to his outfit onfoot. In approaching the fire his path lay closeto my saddle, beneath which Scotch was lying.Tiny Scotch flew at him ferociously; never haveI seen such faithful ferociousness in a dog sosmall and young. I took him in my hands andassured him that the visitor was welcome, and ina moment little Scotch and the cowboy were sideby side gazing at the fire. 132  Text Appearing After Image: SCOTCH NEAR TIMBER-LINE I suppose his bravery and watchful spirit maybe instinct inherited from his famous forbearswho lived so long and so cheerfully on Scotlandsheaths and moors. But, with all due respect forinherited qualities, he also has a brain that doesa little thinking and meets emergencies promptlyand ably. He took serious objection to the coyotes whichhowled, serenaded, and made merry in the edgeof the meadow about a quarter of a mile frommy cabin. Just back of their howling-groundwas a thick forest of pines, in which were scoresof broken rocky crags. Into the tangled forestthe coyotes always retreated when Scotch gavechase, and into this retreat he dared not pursuethem. So long as the coyotes sunned themselves,kept quiet, and played, Scotch simply watchedthem contentedly from afar; but the instant theybegan to howl and yelp, he at once raced overand chased them into the woods. They oftenyelped and taunted him from their safe retreat,but Scotch always took pains to lie down   Note About Images Please note that these images are extracted from scanned page images that may have been digitally enhanced for readability - coloration and appearance of these illustrations may not perfectly resemble the original work."

contentment,http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8389/8491518811_800fbdeed0_z.jpg,0,5,"WATSONFinalSeries1 The concept that I chose was the relationship between a person and their canine friend. In my concept I wanted to specifically focus on one person, a little girl, and one animal, in this case a big black lab. I want to create images that bring out the feeling of comfort or contentment between a person and their animal companions.  Through this series I attempted to uniquely capture this specific feeling between a little girl and her canine best friend. The photos in my series follow a little girl and the day-to-day experiences she has with her four-legged friend. In my series I decided to only focus on one person and one dog. I wanted this series to be more intimate so I focused on one subject and one dog.  For my final series I did not want to show images that were seen everyday by many people, instead I wanted to show intimate experiences that are experienced by many people. An example of this is my third photo. In my photo I have a little girl, my main subject, looking at a family photo album. The little girl is lying on her dogs bed while reading. Instead of just laying next to the girl, the dog has decided to lie on top of the girls legs instead. I liked this photo because it is portraying the feeling of comfort or contentment that I wanted to capture. The girl is content with letting the dog lay on her legs and the dog is content with letting the girl take its bed. I made all of my photos in my final series black and white because I wanted to eliminate any distracting colors in the photo and to bring out some details that would be lost or missed if the photos were in color.  My concept was to portray the intimate relationship between a human and their animal companion. My final series photos illustrate my concept uniquely."

Surely it is enough that the likes of you and I at least try to make our small contribution count for something true and worthy.

May he rest in peace. (A boy iguana with a girl name, I know) I was able to litter box train him and he slept next to me on my bed every night. I still remember the way he smelled, the way it would feel when I would kiss his cold cheeks, and the way he would close his eyes with contentment while I stroked his spikes.   I got him at a fish store for $20 and I had to work hard to convince my mom to let an iguana into the house. I had to remove every inch of wallpaper from the walls. It took me a week. It was SO worth it.  He was so tiny when I got him. I thought that I would crush him if I pet him. When I had him for only (maybe) 6 months, he got out of his terrarium and the cat got into the room. I came home from school and found him lying dead like next to pieces of his tail. I was traumatized but grateful that he survived. His tail grew back, and after just a couple years in the terrarium, he was cage free.   Later, I got a ferret that would steal his food and smell his face. He would sometimes whip his tail at her if she startled him, but, with ferrets being so fast, he never got her. They ended up being good friends.   Years passed and we moved into an apartment where a perfect cat adopted us. She would drink his water while he basked under his heat lamp and he would never show her any resentment or aggression. After what he had been through in the past, I was amazed.   During his last months, we adopted a stray kitten and the kitten became his companion. She would curl up next to him and warm him and purr. It was heartwarming and amazing.  This iguana was the most amazing creature and I feel lucky that I got to spend 13 years of my life with him. "

Is it the fruitful lives they've lived? One thing for sure is that it certainly isn't because they own a huge house or lots of material things.

FOR  Life goes on even though My heart is weeping Bitter tears of sorrow Even though the tears fall My soul is at rest in the arms of God And he bids me welcome to another place And another time where the sun always  Shines and there is peace all the time  SO   I must continue on as long as My voice can shout the victory cry of Jesus I shall do so  EVEN THOUGH   There is crime in the streets And wars all over the world Disease and poverty on every hand  BUT YET  Someone bids me welcome to a land Filled with Milk and Honey And there is no more pain And no more sorrows  What I am trying to say is, things are not what you see The real things are the things that we cannot see with our eyes But the things we see in the spirit While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal. There is a continual battle going on here in this created earth, that is  occupied by the devil and his angels  But  Just above the surface of the earths rim There is peace and contentment in my Fathers House Even though I am a member of this created earth My soul is resting in that higher place In that place of contentment Where the joy of the Lord is my strength  Because  I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. (Phil. 4:10-12) . God also taught me just the other day that no matter what kind of disease Comes our way, be it dementia, cancer or any other kind of disease that He is still God. Disease does not stop my faith in God , even though sometimes the path is hard and the road is long, right at the end of it all, there is a man named Jesus, who died to set us free from death, hell and the grave!   AND  I STILL BELIEVE!!!!!!!!!  "

After I had done a few loads of laundry and gotten some housework done, I decided to hit the road and do a little exploring. I packed my gear and some snacks in the car and I was on my way. Driving is such a great way for me to clear my head and get some good thinking done.   I saw this barn and two others right next to it (one that is falling down) from the highway. It's not like driving down local roads, when I see a barn, I just pull over. I'm on the highway driving 65+ and I have no idea how to get over to these barns. I quickly remembered that the theme for my day was to explore and as soon as I got to the next exit I got off. I then headed down a little road in the direction that I was coming from and had to make a decision as to which way to turn a few times. I felt which way to go and made the right choices because I ended up finding the barns without any problem.  There was also a little spot to easily park my car. I went into the back seat to get out my gear, I had planned to shoot with my DSLR after I took my iPhone shot, but I had forgotten to grab my camera off the kitchen table. I had everything else, tripod, multiple lenses, reflector, even my TLR. But not my 40D.  I took my selfie, along with a few other shots of the location that I'll post later. As I was putting my tripod away, another photographer drove up and we talked for a bit. He had been here over the summer and had been having a difficult time finding it again. This was his first time back.  I made sure that I wrote down directions on my way back to the highway (being guided my my GPS), so I can return here again with all of my equipment.   For February's Alphabet Fun - Letter E - exploring and for ODC - weather. The weather was clear, sunny and  unseasonably warm.  View large and on black. "

Measures approximately 9"" tall x 10"" wide  Great addition to any collection. ***all sizes are approximate. We ship worldwide.  History: According to Chinese history, Budai was an eccentric Chn monk (Chinese: ; pinyin: chn) who lived in China during the Later Liang Dynasty (907923 CE). He was a native of Fenghua, and his Buddhist name was Qieci (Chinese: ; pinyin: qic; literally ""Promise this""). He was considered a man of good and loving character. The term buddha means ""one who is awake"", connoting one who has awakened into enlightenment. Over the history of Buddhism, there have been several notable figures who would come to be remembered as, and referred to as, buddhas. Later followers of the Chan school would come to teach that all beings possess Buddha nature within them, and are already enlightened, but have yet to realize it. This teaching would continue into Zen. Budai is often conflated with (or simply replaces) the historical Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, in spite of the distinct visual differences in how each has been depicted. In India, Nepal, and throughout southeast Asia, Gautama (who lived during the 6th century BCE) is commonly depicted as being tall and slender in appearance. In contrast, in China and those areas to which Chinese cultural influence spread, the depiction of Budai (who lived during the 10th century CE) is consistently short and round.  Folklore: Budai in folklore is admired for his happiness, plenitude, and wisdom of contentment. One belief popular in folklore maintains that rubbing his belly brings wealth, good luck, and prosperity. In Japan, Hotei persists in folklore as one of the Seven Lucky Gods (Shichi Fukujin) of Taoism.  HOTEI  God of Contentment & Happiness Origin = China Taoism / Buddhism  Chinese Name Budai or Putai Said to be an incarnation of Miroku Bosatsu Miroku in China is known as Miluo Fo (or as Miluo Pusa) Hotei known as the Fat Buddha or Laughing Buddha in the West Hotei is one of Japans Seven Lucky Gods. Reportedly based on a real person. Associated Virtue = Magnanimity  Hotei . Male. The god of contentment and happiness, guardian of children, and patron of bartenders. Hotei  has a cheerful face and a big belly. He is supposedly based on an actual person, and is widely recognized outside of Japan as the Fat, Laughing Buddha. He carries a large cloth bag over his back (Nunobukuro , lit. = cloth bag), one that never empties, for he uses it to feed the poor and needy. It includes an inexhaustible cache of treasures, including food and drink. Indeed, the Japanese spelling of Hotei literally means cloth bag. He also holds a Chinese fan called an oogi  (said to be a wish giving fan -- in the distant past, this type of fan was used by the aristocracy to indicate to vassals that their requests would be granted). Hotei is most likely based on the itinerant 10th-century Chinese Buddhist monk and hermit Budaishi (d. 917), who is said to be an incarnation of Miroku Bodhisattva (Maitreya in Sanskrit).  Hotei is sometimes shown surrounded by a group of small children, romping and squealing in delight around his rotund shape. For many more details on Hotei, click here for story by Jennifer Polden.  In recent times, Hotei is also referred to as the patron saint of restaurateurs and bartenders. When one over eats and over drinks, one may sometimes jokingly attribute it to Hoteis influence.  ***It's the buyer's responsibility to pay customs fees, duties, import taxes, and related charges.

A good part of the year, I'm either seeing the sun coming up over the horizon or it is up and casting that beautiful morning light and long shadows.   I'm just not much of a morning person. And I never will be, despite being forced to get up so early for work Monday through Friday. But, when I found out the theme for Me Again Monday this week was your favorite prop, shooting in this beautiful light came to mind. Rather than a favorite, this is a prop that I've been wanting to use since I was doing my 365. It's my daughter's guitar. Thanks, babe, for letting me use it!  So, I skipped my usual breakfast, grabbed a piece of fruit and one cup of coffee instead, showered, got ready and headed out the door. This field is across from a golf course on a medium-busy street. I parked in the course parking lot. There were already grounds keepers working, but I ignored them and headed across the street with my gear.   So there I was, alone in this big field, wearing undergarments, taking pictures of myself. The ground was really wet from the morning dew. The longer I was there, the more cars were traveling down the street. Luckily no one beeped, hopefully everyone was still too sleepy to care. Or remember. Or recognize me.  It was so great to get this done and out of the way. All day long, I had that ""Clark Kent feeling"" like I had a secret that no one else was in on. And that feeling lasted all the way into the evening as I sat at a photography club meeting. I would never have done this stuff 20 years ago!
