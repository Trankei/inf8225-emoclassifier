retains its image niche its eastern face and there are more image niches these with elaborate foliage pedestals the buttresses the tower everything topped off lead and timber fleche which was apparently the model for the one peter mancroft norwich church which has several features common with this one the tower delight the buttressing and pinnacles exactly proportion make appear rise like fairy castle from the ground the south porch contrast despite its flushwork rather austere result its rebuilding early the 19th century before the ecclesiological movement took hold all all this good 15th century rebuilding gets the money coming thanks anne harling having less than three husbands who all wanted spend little time purgatory possible you step down into wide space which dull day can rather gloomy although inevitably heavily restored the victorians peter and paul does not have that depressingly anonymous urban feel you often find churches this size this partly because the beautiful parclose screen the south aisle partitions off much space creating sense rooms within rooms altering the way your eyes are inevitably drawn the east the rood screen must have been vast here its dado survives the west end deeply traceried affair with its features presented carving rather than painting when the rood screen was its proper place move from the nave into the chancel must have been like stepping from darkness into light this because the feature that makes east harling famous the vast east window with its 15th century glass after peter mancroft the best collection norfolk unusually the provenance the glass fairly welldocumented can fairly certain that came from this church originally still present after the reformation was removed the harling family the hall the early 17th century they may have been laudians wanting preserve from the intentions the puritans merely thought would look nice their dining hall whatever know that shortly before francis blomefield visited here the 1730s was returned the church and set its present configuration 1939 when war threatened was removed again being reset just before cautley visited the early 1950s there are parts least three sequences here two which were almost certainly the east window originally and one which almost certainly wasnt essentially the window contains two rosary sequences the joyful mysteries the blessed virgin which include the annunciation the nativity and the assumption and the sorrowful mysteries the blessed virgin which include the crucifixion and the deposition however this open interpretation shall see there also the figure mary magdalene which may once have been associated with nave altar and would have been located window there the five lights contain four rows panels making twenty

consisting three sequences five mysteries each but the late middle ages things were much more flexible and rosary sequences often consisted seven mysteries the glorious mysteries sequence which the assumption now part later development and the two adorations shown here are subsumed into single mystery there are couple images here that dont quite fit the wedding canaa obviously marian text and yet not traditionally rosary subject similarly the betrayal the only one the images not feature mary wonder what have here are parts two separate sequences marian sequence mysteries viiix and passion sequence xiixiv xviixix they are both clearly the work the same workshop and mary always shown with the same face and dress but this would not preclude them from being two sequences why were they here all need get away from thinking such things poor mans bible the need for which was superseded the reformation these were devotional objects designed used meditations while praying and saying the rosary they were created the 15th century time when the mind the church was fiercely concentrated asserting orthodox catholic doctrine the face local superstitions and abuses such they were anathema the reformers and were later elsewhere destroyed for being superstitious not for being superfluous 18th century antiquarian mind ignorant the nature catholic devotion might easily mix the two sequences into historical order and possibly misunderstand the assumption obviously mary reappears two images the ascension out order wonder what they thought was couple other things about the east window that you shouldnt miss firstly everywhere you look there are tiny baskets  mortlock calls them frails and tells that they were simple rush baskets used workmen carry tools also though not such profusion there are bodices these symbols are repeated elsewhere the church stone tombs and such must symbols the harling family another symbol high the north side red squirrel curiously this also

its eastern face and there are more image niches these with elaborate foliage pedestals the buttresses the tower everything topped off lead and timber fleche which was apparently the model for the one peter mancroft norwich church which has several features common with this one the tower delight the buttressing and pinnacles exactly proportion make appear rise like fairy castle from the ground the south porch contrast despite its flushwork rather austere result its rebuilding early the 19th century before the ecclesiological movement took hold all all this good 15th century rebuilding gets the money coming thanks anne harling having less than three husbands who all wanted spend little time purgatory possible you step down into wide space which dull day can rather gloomy although inevitably heavily restored the victorians peter and paul does not have that depressingly anonymous urban feel you often find churches this size this partly because the beautiful parclose screen the south aisle partitions off much space creating sense rooms within rooms altering the way your eyes are inevitably drawn the east the rood screen must have been vast here its dado survives the west end deeply traceried affair with its features presented carving rather than painting when the rood screen was its proper place move from the nave into the chancel must have been like stepping from darkness into light this because the feature that makes east harling famous the vast east window with its 15th century glass after peter mancroft the best collection norfolk unusually the provenance the glass fairly welldocumented can fairly certain that came from this church originally still present after the reformation was removed the harling family the hall the early 17th century they may have been laudians wanting preserve from the intentions the puritans merely thought would look nice their dining hall whatever know that shortly before francis blomefield visited here the 1730s was returned the church and set its present configuration 1939 when war threatened was removed again being reset just before cautley visited the early 1950s there are parts least three sequences here two which were almost certainly the east window originally and one which almost certainly wasnt essentially the window contains two rosary sequences the joyful mysteries the blessed virgin which include the annunciation the nativity and the assumption and the sorrowful mysteries the blessed virgin which include the crucifixion and the deposition however this open interpretation shall see there also the figure mary magdalene which may once have been associated with nave altar and would have been located window there the five lights contain four rows panels making twenty altogether top row annunciation mary her prayer desk gabriel crowned and haloed with sceptre lilies kneels supplication visitation elizabeth hooded show her age places her hand marys pregnant belly iii nativity two

second husband anne harling xvii resurrection christ steps fully clothed from the tomb unusually the soldiers are awake xviii ascension christ mary surrounded disciples watches her son ascends heaven xix descent the holy spirit mary surrounded disciples receives the holy spirit pentecost donor probably william chamberlain first husband anne harling nowadays tend think the rosary consisting three sequences five mysteries each but the late middle ages things were much more flexible and rosary sequences often consisted seven mysteries the glorious mysteries sequence which the assumption now part later development and the two adorations shown here are subsumed into single mystery there are couple images here that dont quite fit the wedding canaa obviously marian text and yet not traditionally rosary subject similarly the betrayal the only one the images not feature mary wonder what have here are parts two separate sequences marian sequence mysteries viiix and passion sequence xiixiv xviixix they are both clearly the work the same workshop and mary always shown with the same face and dress but this would not preclude them from being two sequences why were they here all need get away from thinking such things poor mans bible the need for which was superseded the reformation these were devotional objects designed used meditations while praying and saying the rosary they were created the 15th century time when the mind the church was fiercely concentrated asserting orthodox catholic doctrine the face local superstitions and abuses such they were anathema the reformers and were later elsewhere destroyed for being superstitious not for being superfluous 18th century antiquarian mind ignorant the nature catholic devotion might easily mix the two sequences into historical order and possibly misunderstand the assumption obviously mary reappears two images the ascension out order wonder what they thought was couple other things about the east window that you shouldnt miss firstly everywhere you look there are tiny baskets  mortlock calls them frails and tells that they were simple rush baskets used workmen carry tools also though not such profusion there are bodices these symbols are repeated elsewhere the church stone tombs and such must symbols the harling family another symbol high the north side red squirrel curiously this also appears the painting

starling represents well you guess july 2006 chris harrison and came across some more glass from east harling the norfolk county archaeologist service archive gressenhall was probably removed from the

hill rulers great empire vast wealth romancing sabaean queens and hanging with hiram the phoenician king tyre city which truly was big aweinspiring deal that time the book ezekiel yahweh conveys warning hiram not let success his head and claim that god the seat gods the midst the sea give much credit hiram continues behold you are wiser than daniel your great wisdom trade you have increased your riches 281213 you were the seal perfection full wisdom and perfect beauty   but wealth leads pride and the proud are doomed will bring  the most terrible the nations and they shall  defile your splendor they shall throw you down into the pit  etc was believed the 500s when the book ezekiel was written that hiram had helped the construction the 1st temple over 300 years earlier that could sufficient basis for the amount attention paid him ezekiel and biblical authors any lebanese cedar used would have been purchased tyre the southernmost phoenician citystate there could have been connection between jerusalem and tyre not with hiram directly its ironic hiram best known today for what the old testament authors wrote about him give heft david and solomon the earlytomid1stmillenium david and solomon have long since returned the favour  update nov 2017 these past weeks ive been reading some vol amlie kuhrts encyclopedic the ancient near east from which predates the article that was basis for much what written above the aggrandizement david and solomon she confirms although again years back that theres nothing the archaeological record which supports the accounts the books kings and samuel the brief but glorious 10th century united kingdom israel and judah although the tel dan stele confirms the existence dynasty house the late 800s sired david but she notes that this shouldnt surprising little the way written evidence anything from that period has been found the region and jerusalem itself had been built over and rebuilt over much has the millenia since then and absence evidence isnt evidence absence must stressed that above all due the accounts the old testament that reconstruction the history israel and judah possible did not have israel and judah would little more than names the assyrian annals and hamath samal bit agusi even moab would much better known the reason that lengthy monumental inscriptions have been recovered from either israel judah for this period apart from reference israel inscription from moab and the possible mention judah stele fragment from tel dan the only certain extrabiblical references israel and judah occur the assyrian records but then prof stenger had this say 2007 some have argued that the remains solomons temple and other signs 10th cent golden age jerusalem have been wiped out later building projects however the extensive excavations carried jerusalem modern times have yielded impressive finds from much earlier periods such the middle bronze age and iron age then again excavations directed the late prof shiloh uncovered monumental stepped structure and dated the 12th10th cent and which some claim basis the jebusite town that david conquered and there are details the books samuel considered contain the earliest records the old testament davids conquest jerusalem which are consistent with features the city david the oldest part town and more that vein the truth out there  tyre was the original home queen jezebel wife the israelite king ahab condemned elijah eaten dogs for her worship phoenician gods and europa princess abducted zeus the form white bull and taken crete where she gave birth minos who became king the minoan civilization the first europe which may why europe was named after her was also ruled king pygmalion whose legendary sister dido fled from her home here berber territory north africa where she founded carthage  the island withstood sieges the babylonian king nebuchadnezzar and and the achaemenid persians phoenician sailing prowess was instrumental the persian conquest egypt earlier the history the persian empire until the incredible month siege alexander the great who built kmlong causeway the island under cover his innovative new catapults laid waste tyre crucified 2000 locals the shore and sold 30000 into slavery but you can see here although tyres most glorious period ended with hellenism tyre continued great centre the roman ruins are impressive and the hippodrome here was the largest the ancient world area but not seating tyre continued wealthy influential place throughout the byzantine period the period the crusades took several sieges before the city was taken christian forces was the only city hold out against baldwin jerusalem and held out against saladin well some more tyre under the crusaders here'
